PROCOMM PLUS - Addendum to the User's Manual

Copyright (C) 1988 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
All Rights Reserved

The following additions and corrections apply to
PROCOMM PLUS version 1.1A.

Corrections:

-    Page 73 of the manual indicates that the maximum length of a dial
     command, including dialing codes, is 40 characters.  With version 1.1A,
     that length has been expanded to 60 characters.
-    Page 96 - FULL and HALF DUPLEX messages are not displayed.  The status
     line will indicate the current duplex setting.
-    PROCOMM PLUS now lets you remap 79 keys for each of the supported
     emulations, rather than the 61 reported on pages 101, 104, 157 and 159.
-    Page 111 - The redisplay buffer now holds 10000 characters.  In
     addition, Screen Snapshot is no longer supported.  Use the [W] command
     to write the buffer to disk.
-    The default for Autobaud Detect is OFF, not ON as described on page 133.
-    The section on Terminal Options beginning on page 137 should be entitled
     Terminal General Options, the first menu choice after selecting Terminal
     Options from the main Setup menu.
-    The option Aborted Downloads described on page 142 has been moved to
     the Protocol Options screen.
-    The Files/Paths Option Default Path for Downloaded Files is no longer
     used by Host Mode, as there is a separate option specifically for Host
     Mode in the Host Mode Options screen.
-    There is no longer a Color Option for the Communications Screen
     (Terminal Mode) as indicated on pages 151 and 152.  Terminal colors now
     have their own menu as the second menu choice after selecting Terminal
     Options from the main Setup menu.
-    The discussion on pages 167-171 regarding access to the current
     directory in Host is only applicable if no specific Download Directory
     has been specified in Host Mode Options screen of the Setup facility.
-    A note on page 172 indicates that the S)hell option is available only
     for COM1 and COM2.  COM3 and COM4 are also supported if you are using
     DOS 3.3 or above.
-    Chat Mode in Host Mode is now character oriented rather than line
     oriented as described on page 173.  That is, each character is sent as
     it is pressed, rather than waiting for the [CR] to send the whole line.
-    When using the ISFILE ASPECT command as described on page 228, you may
     include a path specification with the filename.
-    The SOUND command described on page 248 accepts the duration argument
     in hundreds of a second, rather than milliseconds.  Thus the example
     SOUND 440 500 will sound and "A" for 5 seconds, not 1/2 second.
-    The WHEN command described on page 258 remains in effect until a CWHEN
     command or another WHEN command is issued.
-    Control of the ANSI terminal emulation as described on page 301
     conforms to the DOS 2.x or DOS 3.x ANSI.SYS device driver depending
     upon the setting of the ANSI Compatibility option on the General
     Options screen of the Setup facility.

Additions:
An additional ASPECT script command has been created.

     SET MENUMODE ON|OFF controls how the keystrokes are processed during
     script file execution.  With MENUMODE OFF, the default, keystrokes are
     passed to the terminal processor, where they are handled like usual.
     With MENUMODE ON, keystrokes are held in the keyboard buffer for
     processing by the script file.  For example, if you press [PgDn] within
     a script file with MENUMODE OFF, the File Download window will appear,
     just like in Terminal Mode.  With MENUMODE ON, however, the keystroke
     waits in the buffer until processed by a KEYGET or similar command.  SET
     MENUMODE ON is handy for programmers developing menu'd applications
     where you want to limit the users choices of options.

One ASPECT command has been modified.

     The SET DISPLAY ON/OFF previously controlled display of incoming
     characters only during a WAITFOR or RGET command.  SET DISPLAY OFF now
     suppresses display of all incoming characters.

Several Setup options have been added to give you better control over your
on-line sessions.

     In the General Setup there is now an option called "ANSI Compatibility"
     which controls PROCOMM PLUS' ANSI emulation.  You may set PROCOMM PLUS
     to conform to the DOS 2.x ANSI.SYS driver, or the DOS 3.x ANSI.SYS
     driver.  In 2.x mode, clear screen and erase end of line commands clear
     to white on black.  In 3.x mode, they clear to the current colors.  This
     setting has nothing to do with the version of DOS you are using, as
     PROCOMM PLUS does not use the ANSI.SYS driver.  Rather it controls how
     PROCOMM PLUS interprets incoming ANSI screen control sequences.  If you
     notice that BBS graphics screens are not displaying as you expect, try
     changing this option.

     Control of terminal mode colors has been broken out of the Color Option
     menu and given a menu of its own.  Select Terminal Options, then Color
     Options to access.  5 display attributes are now available for use by
     the terminal emulations: normal, high, low, reverse and underline.  Note
     that not all emulations use all of the available attributes.  To change
     an attribute, press the letter corresponding to that attribute. Then
     enter the number of the desired color from the list.  The window to the
     right will display the attributes as currently selected.

The Redisplay option has had an additional capability added.  Press [W] when
in Redisplay (Alt-F6) to write the contents of the redisplay buffer to a disk
file.  Screen Snapshot (Alt-G) in Redisplay is no longer supported.
The following additions and corrections apply to
PROCOMM PLUS version 1.1.
Corrections:

-    The keys to press in the Line Settings Menu (Alt-P) have changed.  The
     new values are obvious from the menu itself, but the discussion of
     those keys on page 21 and pages 124-125 is now inaccurate.
-    The ABORTED DOWNLOADS item in Setup General Options (page 142) has been
     moved to the Protocol Options menu.
-    Page 202 refers to a MATSAY command which does not exist.
-    The following ASPECT commands are not documented:

     SET DUPLEX FULL|HALF               Sets the duplex mode.
     REDIAL                             Redial numbers in the dialing queue.
     SENDFILE SEALINK "filename"|Sx     (page 242)

-    The summary of disk and file commands on page 185 should include FREAD,
     which reads a block of data from the input file (see pg. 218).
-    The summary of string commands on page 186 should include STRFMT, which
     creates a formatted string (see pg. 249).
-    References in the manual to TeleVideo terminals as TVI9xx should be
     replaced with TV9xx.
-    The script file example on page 189 is for an older version of PC
     Pursuit and will not function as written.  A corrected script file for
     accessing PC Pursuit is provided on the supplemental disk.
-    The discussion of files placement and up- and downloading in Host Mode
     in chapter 9 is somewhat inaccurate due to additions discussed below.
     Corrections are as follows:

          Page 164, Directory for Downloaded Files: This paragraph
          should be deleted.  Files uploaded to Host mode are
          placed in the directory specified as the "Upload
          Directory" in the Host Mode Options section of the Setup
          Facility.

          Page 165, additions: Download Directory:  This is the
          directory that you wish users to have access to for the
          F)iles and D)ownload commands.  Upload Directory:  This
          is the directory where files upload to Host mode will be
          placed.

          Page 168, first bullet: Users will be allowed access to
          the current  directory only if a Download Directory is
          not specified in Setup.

          Page 168, second to last bullet: Same as above.

          Page 170, Files: This command displays a list of files in
          the  specified Download Directory or, if no Download
          Directory has been named, in the current directory.
          Users are prompted for a filespec to list.  Users may see
          all files by pressing [Enter].

          Page 170, Upload/Download: Files are transferred to or
          from the current directory only if you have not named
          specific Upload and Download directories.
-    The following keyboard mapping table should replace that for the
     3270/950 emulation on pages 310-311.

and release the key you wish to use in conjunction with FUNCT. This will
send the standard 3 byte FUNCT sequence: <SOH> <key pressed> <CR>.
Additions:
Several Setup options have been added.

       The pause translation character (see page 291) which was previously
       hard coded to be a tilde (~), is now user settable via General Options
       in Setup.

       An option to strip the 8th bit during ASCII file transfers has been
       added to the ASCII Transfer Options menu.  Setting this option to YES
       causes PROCOMM PLUS to automatically strip the 8th bit from characters
       being sent or received during ASCII file transfers.

       Modem General Options now has a item that controls if the
       initialization string is sent if CD is found high at program startup.
       You might want to set this to NO if, for instance, you intend to exit
       PROCOMM PLUS without disconnecting and you wish to return to your on-
       line session without sending the init string.

Several changes have been made to the Host mode.

       Most significant is the addition of user specified up- and download
       paths (specified via Host Options in the Setup Facility).  Normal
       (non-super) users can only download files residing in the host
       download directory and the F)iles command will only list files in that
       directory.  Superusers may download from any directory and they may
       upload to any subdirectory (if the protocol doesn't transfer the file
       name internally).  By default, all files received by the host will be
       placed in the host upload directory.  CAUTION: If you fail to define
       these Host directories before using Host mode, any caller can download
       files from, or upload files to the current directory.

       Host mode F)iles command now prompts for a file spec (same as DIR)
       (Normal users can only supply NAME.EXT, superusers can use paths).

       The Host mode message to begin remote transfer now contains the
       protocol name.

       Host mode pauses after displaying initialization error message(s).

       Host S)hell command accepts COM3 and COM4 as devices if DOS version
       is 3.3 or higher.

PROCOMM PLUS' support of CompuServe's CIS B protocol now includes support
for QUICK B as well.

A sorting routine for dialing directories is now included on the
supplemental diskette.  To use it, enter

   SORTDIR [dirname]

at the DOS prompt.  If "dirname" is not specified it will default to
PCPLUS.DIR.  You should not use this program via PROCOMM PLUS' DOS gateway.

A selection window for ASP files has been added to the Alt-F5 option (see
page 180).  By pressing [Enter] at the filename prompt, you will be
presented with a list of .ASP files in the current directory.  If no .ASP
files exist there, the PROCOMM PLUS will display .ASP files in the directory
pointed to by the PCPLUS= environment variable.  If no .ASP files are found
in either location, the message "NO ASP FILES" will be displayed.  To select
a file for execution, use the up and down arrow keys to position the
highlighted bar on the desired file and press [Enter].  The [PgUp] and
[PgDn] will page the display up or down.  The [Home] key will take you to
the first page of entries; the [End] key will take you to the last.
Two additional ASPECT commands have been created.

       SET DISPLAY ON|OFF controls whether or not characters received from
       the remote during the execution of a WAITFOR or RGET command are
       displayed.  Use this option to inhibit display of incoming characters
       in menu driven .ASP files and the like.

       DLOAD "filename" will load an alternate dialing directory.  Specify a
       directory name without the .DIR extension, i.e. MLOAD "atlanta".

Upgrading ProComm 2.4.2 to PROCOMM PLUS
Converting an existing ProComm 2.4.2 installation to PROCOMM PLUS is a
relatively simple task.  Some files may be used without modification, some
will need to be changed, and some must be recreated.

ProComm keyboard macro (.KEY) and translate table (.XLT) files may be used
without modification.  Simply rename PROCOMM.KEY to PCPLUS.KEY, and
PROCOMM.XLT to PCPLUS.XLT.

If you are using a host mode welcome file (PROCOMM.MSG), rename it to
PCPLUS.NWS.  PCPLUS.MSG is used to store host mode mail messages.

The dialing directory file structure has changed completely, so PROCOMM.DIR
must be converted.  To do so, run the supplied convert program CVTDIR.EXE.
This program will transfer your existing entries from PROCOMM.DIR to
PCPLUS.DIR.

The parameter file structure has also changed, but no convert routine is
supplied. Begin by reviewing (or printing) the setup options you have
specified within ProComm.  Now execute the PROCOMM PLUS setup facility and
compare its defaults to what you used with ProComm and make any pertinent
changes.  Please note one change: ProComm used several "output translation
characters" which PROCOMM PLUS does not support.  The non-supported
characters are the exclamation point (!) for a carriage return, and the
vertical bar (|) for an escape. The caret (^) for a control character and
tilde (~) for a pause are still supported. In PROCOMM PLUS, use a Ctrl-M
(^M) in place of the exclamation point to send a carriage return;  use Ctrl-
left bracket (^[) to send an escape.

ProComm command files (*.CMD) are easily converted to PROCOMM PLUS ASPECT
command files.  Begin by renaming all .CMD files to .ASP files (REN *.CMD
*.ASP).  Within those files make two changes.  First, make sure that all
command keywords are completely spelled out.  PROCOMM PLUS does not support
abbreviated keywords.  Secondly, change all the output translation
characters as described above.

In addition, several script commands have changed:

-      SET BACKSPACE IN DEST|NONDEST is now SET BACKSPACE DEST|NONDEST.
-      SET BACKSPACE OUT is no longer supported.  Use PCKEYMAP to assign the
       output value for the backspace key.
-      SET CR_IN CR|CR_LF is now SET CR CR|CR_LF.
-      SET CR_OUT is no longer supported.  Use PCKEYMAP to assign the output
         value for the Enter key.
-      SET FLOWCTRL ON|OFF is now SET SOFTFLOW ON|OFF.

After making these simple changes you should be off and running with PROCOMM
PLUS.

Using external file transfer protocols with PROCOMM PLUS
PROCOMM PLUS includes internal support for a wide variety of file transfer
protocols.  In addition, it provides "hooks" to allow you to access external
programs which support other protocols.  Six hooks are provided: three for
uploading and three for downloading.

External protocol programs are specified within PROCOMM PLUS via the
Protocols Options section of the Setup facility.  To add an external
protocol, enter the Setup facility by pressing [Alt-S] from PROCOMM PLUS'
terminal mode. Now press [P] to select protocol options.

Options A-F on the Protocol Options Menu are used to tell PROCOMM PLUS what
external programs to use.  For example, to set up PROCOMM PLUS to use ZMODEM
as external protocol 1, enter ZMODEM-U as the choice for uploading (option
A) and ZMODEM-D for downloading (option B).  The names entered here will be
displayed in the protocol selection window after pressing PgUp or PgDn to
transfer a file.  They will also be the programs called by PROCOMM PLUS to
perform those transfers.

When you select an external protocol from the protocol selection window
(choices 14-16) you will be prompted for parameters which are passed along
to the external program.

It is often convenient to use DOS .BAT files when specifying external
protocols. In the example above the actual program used to perform ZMODEM
up- and downloads is called DSZ.EXE.  DSZ accepts numerous command options,
most of which do not change between uses.  By using a batch file you spare
yourself the trouble of entering the necessary options each time you perform
a ZMODEM transfer.  For example, ZMODEM-D refers to a batch file called
ZMODEM-D.BAT. It contains the following line:

   DSZ rz C:\DL

This line calls DSZ and tells it to receive a file using ZMODEM (rz) and
create the file(s) in the directory C:\DL.  Since the filename is passed
from the sending system in ZMODEM transfers, you may just press [Enter] at
the parameters prompt.

Uploading is a little trickier, but not much.  In that case you must let DSZ
know which file(s) to upload.  You can do that by specifying the name of the
file(s) to upload when prompted by PROCOMM PLUS for ZMODEM-U parameters.
Whatever you enter is then passed to ZMODEM-U.BAT when it is called.  By
including the line

   DSZ sz %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9

in ZMODEM-U.BAT, the filenames are passed to DSZ via the % batch file
variables.

The 2 .BAT files and DSZ.EXE should be placed in a directory included in
your PATH.  Also note that files downloaded using external protocols will not
automatically be placed in the default download dierectory specified in the
FILE/PATH OPTIONS screen of the Setup facility.
The same techniques may be used for specifying other programs to call for
performing external protocol transfers.

[NOTE: DSZ is a user-supported program developed and supported by Chuck
Forsberg.  It is available as DSZ.ARC on many BBS and on-line services
around the country.  Non-registered users of DSZ are granted a license to
use the program for a limited evaluation period.  Regular use requires
registration ($20.00 check) to :   Omen Technology Inc.

The following additions and corrections apply to the PROCOMM PLUS User's
Manual for version 1.0.
Additions:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-      An editor has been included with PROCOMM PLUS.  The editor program,
       called PCEDIT.EXE, is a small, fast text editor suitable for use
       writing ASPECT scripts and the like.  It is provided as a separate
       executable file called via the [Alt-A] editor command.  It may be run
       standalone as well with a command of the form "PCEDIT filename [/b]".
       The optional "/b" parameter causes the editor to operate in black and
       white rather than color for composite monitors.  Help for PCEDIT may
       be obtained by pressing [Alt-Z] from within the program.

-      The Redisplay buffer has an additional command: W (Write file).  When
       selected, the contents of the Redisplay Buffer will be written to a
       disk file of the specified name.

The ASPECT script language has the following additional commands:

-      IF [NOT] HITKEY

       The HITKEY condition of the IF command will test TRUE if a key has
       been pressed and remains in the input buffer.  For example, in the
       following code fragment, execution will loop endlessly until a key is
       pressed.

   WAIT:
   IF NOT HITKEY
      GOTO WAIT
   ENDIF

-      KEYGET Sx

       The KEYGET command gets from the user's console a single key, and
       places it in the specified string variable.  This command allows you
       to get a single keystroke without requiring that [Enter] be pressed.
       The characters placed in the string variable depend upon the key
       pressed. For printable characters (ASCII values 32 through 126) the
       actual character is used.  For other keys, the scan code in hex is
       placed in the variable.  To determine what is returned by a given key,
       use the following ASPECT commands:

   TOP:
   ATSAY 10 10 31 "Press any key: "
   LOCATE 10 25
   KEYGET S0
   ATSAY 11 25 31 "    "
   FATSAY 11 10 31 "The value was: %s" S0
   GOTO TOP

       This command is very handy for building menus and the like where you
       can SWITCH on the key pressed to perform a given function.

-      IF [NOT] relation Nx Ny|integer
       The IF relation commands tests for some arithmetic relation between
       two numeric variables or a numeric variable and an integer constant.
       The valid relations are:

   GT - Greater than (Nx > Ny ?)
   LT - Less than (Nx < Ny ?)
   GE - Greater than or equal to (Nx >= Ny ?)
   LE - Less than or equal to (Nx <= Ny ?)
   EQ - Equal to (Nx = Ny ?)

       For example, the following code segment tests if the value of N1 is
       equal or greater to 25, and branches to a subroutine if it is.

   IF GE N1 25
      GOSUB SUB1
   ENDIF

       An additional IF condition has been added: MONO.  For example, in the
       following code fragment, the CLEAR command will be executed if a
       monochrome monitor is detected.

   IF MONO
      CLEAR 7
   ENDIF

       Most ASPECT script commands have been modified to accept numeric
       variables as well as constants for the ROW, COL and ATTRIB parameters.
       For example, you may now use commands such as:

       ATSAY N1 N2 N3 "Use variable row, column and attrib"
       ATGET N1 N2 N3 N4 S0
       etc
