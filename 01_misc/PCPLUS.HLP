General Help - Terminal Mode (2 of 2)
PROCOMM PLUS emulates the following video display terminals: TTY, DEC VT52,
DEC VT102, ANSI X3.64, IBM 3101, TeleVideo 900 series (910, 920, 925, 950,
955), Wyse 50, Wyse 100, Heath/Zenith 19, ADDS Viewpoint 60, Lear Siegler
ADM3/5, plus a special "3270" emulation for use with IBM mainframe protocol
converters.  The current emulation can be changed from the Setup Facility
(Alt-S).

The emulations respond to the Ctrl-E (ENQ) enquiry character by sending
the string stored for keyboard macro [Alt-0].  This "answerback message" is
sent only if ENQ is set to ON in the Setup Facility ([Alt-S]).

Outgoing key codes can be changed for each emulation by using the PROCOMM PLUS
key mapping facility ([Alt-F8]).
File Directory (1 of 1)
The PROCOMM PLUS File Directory command lets you list the files in any
directory or disk.

At the prompt, enter any valid file specification.  You may include a drive
and path designator, as well as the DOS wildcard characters * and ?.  If you
press [Enter] without typing in a file specification, PROCOMM PLUS will list
all the files in the current directory.

If "MORE" appears at the bottom of the display, press any key to see
additional files.  If it doesn't, pressing any key will return you to Terminal
mode.

For more information, see the "File Directory" section of chapter 7, "Using
PROCOMM PLUS Commands", in the manual.
View a File (1 of 2)
Use the View a File feature to examine a text file without leaving PROCOMM
PLUS.  You may use either the built in view utility or one of your own
choosing.

To use an external utility, specify the name of the program to use on the
Files/Path Options screen of the Setup Facility.  When you press [Alt-V], you
will be prompted for the parameters (such as the filename) to pass to the
external program.

To use the built in view utility, specify the name of the file you wish to
read at the prompt.  Then use the following keys to move around the file:

    Press ...       In order to ...

    [PgDn]          To move to the next page.

    [PgUp]          To move to the preceding page.

    [Home]          To move to the beginning of the file.

    [Esc]           To exit the view utility.

View a File (2 of 2)
For more information, see the "View a File" section of chapter 7, "Using
PROCOMM PLUS Commands", in the manual.
Chat Mode (1 of 1)
PROCOMM PLUS' Chat mode is particularly useful when using the CB Simulators
on CompuServe or GEnie.  Chat mode splits the screen so that what you type
appears on the bottom of the screen, while text received from the remote
appears on top.

Limited line editing is provided for text that you type.  Use the Backspace
key to edit a line before it goes out.  Text is sent to the remote only after
you press [Enter].  CTRL-Q and CTRL-S keystrokes (XON and XOFF) get sent
immediately.

Printer and disk logging will occur if they are active when Chat mode begins.
The redisplay buffer ([Alt-F6]) is available in Chat mode, as are the keyboard
macros [Alt-0] to [Alt-9].  Press ESC to exit Chat mode.

For more information, see the "Chat Mode" section of chapter 7, "Using PROCOMM
PLUS Commands", in the manual.
Kermit Server Cmds (1 of 1)
Use Kermit server commands to communicate with a remote Kermit server. For
these commands to work properly, the remote Kermit must first be placed in
server mode.  If the remote Kermit does not support server mode, use [PgUp]
and [PgDn] to perform Kermit file transfers.

The following Kermit server commands are supported:

    Use ...         In order to ...

    FINISH          To terminate the Kermit session and return you to the
                    system level.

    LOGOUT          To terminate Kermit and log you off the remote computer.

    GET             To receive a file from the Kermit server.

    SEND            To transfer a file to the Kermit server.

For more information, see the "Kermit Server Commands" section of chapter 7,
"Using PROCOMM PLUS Commands", in the manual.
Translation Table (1 of 2)
The PROCOMM PLUS translation table provides a means for you to strip or
replace characters you receive from a remote computer.  When [Alt-W] is
pressed, a table of pairs of ASCII values will appear.  If the translation
table is active, PROCOMM PLUS "filters" the incoming data, replacing the
character represented by the ASCII value in the first column in each pair with
the character represented by the value in the second column.

To translate a given character, type the ASCII value of the character you wish
to replace and press [Enter].  Now type the ASCII value of the replacement
character and press [Enter].  To strip a character, enter 0 as the new value.

The following keys perform other translation table functions:

    Press ...       In order to ...

    [F1]            Save changes you have made to disk.

    [F2]            Display the other half of the translation table.

Translation Table (2 of 2)
    [F3]            Activate the translation table.  If you made changes with
                    the table turned off, be sure to save those changes before
                    activating the table, as PROCOMM PLUS reads the PCPLUS.XLT
                    file from the disk when this key is pressed.

    [F4]            Deactivate the translation table.

    [Esc]           Exit the translation table.

For more information, see the "Changing the Translation Table" section of
chapter 8, "Customizing PROCOMM PLUS", in the manual.
Send Files (1 of 1)
PROCOMM PLUS offers you a variety of protocols for transferring files to other
computers.

To send a file, begin the transfer procedure on the remote computer.  Now
press [PgUp].  PROCOMM PLUS displays a list of available file transfer
protocols.  Enter the number corresponding to the protocol you wish to use and
press [Enter].

PROCOMM PLUS now asks you to name the file you wish to send.  If you have the
Filename Lookup option turned on, PROCOMM PLUS will search the screen for a
valid filename and enter what it finds.  To use that filename, simply press
[Enter].  To use another filename, or if the lookup feature is disabled,
simply type the name of the file to transfer and press [Enter].

PROCOMM PLUS will display a status screen to keep you informed of the progress
of the transfer.

For more information, see the "Send Files" section of chapter 7, "Using
PROCOMM PLUS Commands", in the manual.
Receive Files (1 of 2)
PROCOMM PLUS offers you a variety of protocols for transferring files to other
computers.

To receive a file, begin the transfer procedure on the remote computer.  Now
press [PgDn].  PROCOMM PLUS displays a list of available file transfer
protocols.  The amount of free space on the destination drive is also
displayed.  Type the number corresponding to the protocol you wish to use and
press [Enter].

Depending upon the protocol chosen, PROCOMM PLUS may ask you for the name of
the file you wish to receive.  If you have the Filename Lookup option turned
on, PROCOMM PLUS will search the screen for a valid filename and enter what it
finds.  To use that filename, simply press [Enter].  To use another filename,
or if the lookup feature is disabled, simply type the name of the file and
press [Enter].

If prompted for the file's name, you may include a path specification.  If no
path is included, the file will go to either the directory you have specified
as the default path for downloaded files in the "Files/Path" section of the
Setup Facility, or, if no such entry was made, to the current directory.

Receive Files (2 of 2)
PROCOMM PLUS will display a status screen to keep you informed of the progress
of the transfer.

For more information, see the "Receive Files" section of chapter 7, "Using
PROCOMM PLUS Commands", in the manual.
Change Directory (1 of 1)
PROCOMM PLUS allows you to change the current drive and directory you are
logged to.  The current directory is shown in the top border of the window.
To change it, type the name of the new drive and/or directory and press
[Enter].  Press [Esc] to return to terminal mode without making any changes.

For more information, see the "Change Directory" section of chapter 7, "Using
PROCOMM PLUS Commands", in the manual.
Keyboard Macros (1 of 2)
Keyboard macros allow you to assign character strings to the keys [Alt-0]
through [Alt-9], which may then be used to transmit the assigned string to the
remote.  Macro strings may be up to 50 characters long, and may contain
imbedded control codes using the ^ translate convention described in the
manual.  To send the string you've assigned, simply press the appropriate key
from terminal or chat mode.

After creating a group of macros be sure to save them to disk, using the [S]
option,  or they will be discarded when you leave the current PROCOMM PLUS
session.

You may create and use any number of keyboard macro files for use with
different systems.  By default, PROCOMM PLUS will load the file called
PCPLUS.KEY when it is brought up.  Macro key files may also be loaded via the
MLOAD script command.

Multiple macro key files give you considerable flexibility in using different
systems.  One thing you can do is create different .KEY files for various
systems that you call, then load the macros via a MLOAD command in a script
file linked to that system in the Dialing Directory.  If you use a consistent
scheme (i.e. user ID in [Alt-1], password in [Alt-2]) you can simplify many of

Keyboard Macros (2 of 2)
your online tasks.

   Press ...       In order to ...

   [] or []      Select a macro to revise.

   [R]             Revise the highlighted macro.

   [L]             Load a new .KEY file.  To create a new file, use [C] to
                   clear the existing macros, revise the new entries, then
                   save the new file with the [S] command.

   [S]             Save the current macro set to a disk file.

   [C]             Clear the existing macro set.  This command does not
                   erase the corresponding .KEY file.

   [ESC]           Return to terminal mode.

For more information, see the "Keyboard Macro" section of chapter 7, "Using
PROCOMM PLUS Commands", in the manual.
Redisplay Buffer (1 of 2)
Redisplay allows you to examine text that has scrolled off your screen.
PROCOMM PLUS can redisplay the last 8,000 characters received, starting with
the most recent screen.  With this facility you can scroll through the saved
text a line or a page at a time, find specific text strings, and even save
screen snapshots to disk.

   Press ...       In order to ...

   [PgUp] or       Scroll one screen up or down.
   [PgDn]

   [] or []      Scroll one line up or down.

   [Home]          Display the first (oldest) screen.

   [End]           Display the last (most recent) screen.

   [F] or [/]      Find specific text in the data.  Simply type the text you
                   want to find at the prompt.  To continue searching for
                   the same text, press [Enter] at the search prompt.

current call or the last call made if you are not on-line.  Press "Esc" to
return to terminal mode.
Record Mode (1 of 1)
PROCOMM PLUS uses Record mode to "learn" a remote computer's prompts and your
responses-such as a log-on procedure-to create an ASPECT script file you can
use to automate that procedure.

Press [Alt-R] before beginning the task (such as dialing a system) and then
specify a filename for the script file you want to create.  Include the .ASP
extension before pressing [Enter].  The message "RECORDING" appears on the
left side of the Status line to remind you that PROCOMM PLUS is recording the
remote computer's prompts and your responses.

When the procedure you wish to record is over, press [Alt-R] again.

You will probably want to "fine tune" the script file using your favorite
editor.

For more information, see the "Record Mode" section of chapter 7, "Using
PROCOMM PLUS Commands", in the manual.
Menu Line (1 of 1)
The Menu line is an alternative interface for PROCOMM PLUS.

Select a function from the Menu line by either typing the first letter of the
command, or by highlighting the command (using the [-] and [-] keys) and
pressing [Enter].

The "hot key" used to activate the menu line may be changed in the "General
Options" section of the Setup Facility.

For more information, see the "Using the Menu Line" section of chapter 1,
"Getting Started", in the manual.
Script File Selection (1 of 1)
To execute an ASPECT script file, type the name of the script file (without
the .ASP extension) and press [Enter].  If you are unsure of the name,
pressing [Enter] by itself will open a window displaying the .ASP files in the
current directory.  If no .ASP files exist in the current directory, PROCOMM
PLUS will display files in the directory pointed to by the PCPLUS environment
variable.

To select a file from the window, use the up and down arrow keys to position
the highlight on the desired file and press [Enter].  Use [PgUp] and [PgDn] to
page through the display.

The name of the script file appears at the left of the Status line while it is
being executed.

prompt.

For more information, see the "Script Files" section of chapter 7, "Using
PROCOMM PLUS Commands", in the manual.
Host Mode (1 of 3)
Host mode provides a convenient method of allowing other computers to connect
with yours to transfer files, send messages via electronic mail, converse
on-line, and even execute DOS commands.

With the following exceptions, Host mode treats all local keystrokes as if
they were sent by the remote user.

    Press ...       In order to ...

    [Esc]           Return to terminal mode (or script execution depending on
                    how Host mode was started).

    [F1]            Chat with user.  The remote user is told that the system
                    operator is on-line and the local console is placed into
                    chat mode.  (Unavailable when nobody is connected).

    [Ctrl-X]        Terminate current user and prepare for next user.

    [F2]            Perform a local logon.  This key is available only while
                    Host mode is waiting for a modem connection (the message
                    "Waiting..." appears on the status line).  This feature is

Host Mode (2 of 3)
                    useful for checking the "look and feel" of your system and
                    for performing Host functions without a connection.

Several host mode operating characteristics are defined in the "Host Mode
Options" section of the Setup Facility (help with Host mode options is
available from within that section of the Setup Facility).  Before running
Host mode, confirm the Host mode options setup as well as these settings:

Current             All files in this directory will be available for
directory           downloading if you have not specified a download
                    directory in Host Options Setup.

Line/port setup     The baud rate should be set to the highest speed supported
                    by your modem, unless you have 'Connection type' set to
                    direct.  Also, both computers should be using the same
                    line settings.

Modem setup         Your modem should respond correctly to both the
                    auto-answer function as well as the hangup function.
                    Additionally, if you have Host mode auto baud detect on,
                    your modem must return the connect strings specified in

Host Mode (3 of 3)
                    the "Modem Result Messages" setup.

When a remote user connects and tries to access your system, there are three
actions Host mode may take depending on the user's name, whether or not the
user is found in PCPLUS.USR, and your 'System type' definition.

Deny access         This occurs if a new user tries to access a closed system
                    or if a defined user is unable to enter the correct
                    password after three tries.

Allow normal        This occurs when a defined user logs on with a '0'
access              privilege or when a new user logs on to an open system.

Allow full          This occurs only when a defined user logs on with a
access              privilege that has been set to '1'.

Once a remote user has been validated, the file PCPLUS.NWS is displayed (if it
exists) and the main menu is presented.

For more information, see chapter 9, "Using Host Mode", in the manual.
Key Mapping (1 of 2)
PROCOMM PLUS lets you remap (redefine) any of 79 keys for each of its
supported terminal emulations.  Remapping a key changes the codes sent by that
key when it is pressed.

Press [Space], [PgUp] or [PgDn] to select the emulation you wish to modify.
To change a key definition, press the key you wish to change, then enter the
new code and press [Enter].

To exit the keyboard mapping screen, press [ESC].  If you wish to keep the
changes you have made press "Y", otherwise press "N" to abandon the changes.

[Num Lock] must be active to get keypad 0 through keypad 9 and keypad period.

Dialing Codes (1 of 2)
PROCOMM PLUS lets you specify up to 10 dialing codes.  Each dialing code
represents a series of characters to be dialed along with a telephone number
when the code is encountered.  Dialing codes are used to provide access to
alternate long-distance carriers, to dial through an office PBX or switchboard
equipment, or for other situations when your dialing command must contain
characters other than just the number.

You can use dialing codes by including one or more before, within, or after
the telephone number in a Dialing Directory entry, or by typing one or more
codes before or after the entry number when you dial a computer by typing the
entry number (the [D] command from the Dialing Directory menu).

This menu allows you to revise or erase dialing codes.

   Press ...       In order to ...

   [] or []      Highlight the dialing code to be revised to erased.

For more information, see the "Modem Result Messages" section of chapter 8,
"Customizing PROCOMM PLUS", in the manual.
Modem Result Messages (1 of 2)
When you attempt to make a connection with another computer, your modem
indicates the result by sending a result message (also called a status message
or a status code) to your computer. This message appears on your display; in
addition, PROCOMM PLUS uses it to decide whether to maintain the connection or
to hang up dial again.

To ensure that PROCOMM PLUS recognizes the messages sent by your modem, you
need to tell PROCOMM PLUS what those messages are. By changing the messages in
the MODEM RESULT MESSAGES specifications screen, you can change the messages
PROCOMM PLUS will recognize. Check your modem's manual to find out what
messages it sends.

300 to 19,200       Specifies the message your modem sends if a connection is
baud connect        made at the indicated baud rate.
message
                    Note: The default message for 300 baud is followed by the
                    ^M control code, which represents a carriage-return.  The
                    ^M at the end of the message enables PROCOMM PLUS to
                    distinguish the default connect message for 300 baud from
                    the default connect messages for other baud rates, all of

Modem Port Assignments (1 of 2)
PROCOMM PLUS is capable of working with any of eight COM ports, COM1 through
COM8. On this screen you can specify the base address and the interrupt line
for each COM port.

You normally need not be concerned with these specifications unless you are
installing a COM port from COM3 through COM8. If you are installing one of
these COM ports, see the documentation accompanying the hardware you're
installing to find out how to set the base address and IRQ line for that port
on the hardware.

When you select a COM port to change, PROCOMM PLUS puts the cursor in the base
address. After you press [Enter] , it moves the cursor to the IRQ line for
that port.

The default values for COM1 and COM2 are standard.  PROCOMM PLUS' defaults
for COM3 and COM4 (3E8/IRQ4,2E8/IRQ3) are somewhat standard, but depending
upon the hardware may be reversed as COM3=2E8/IRQ3 and COM4=3E8/IRQ4.

Terminal Color Options (1 of 1)
Use this screen to set the default terminal mode colors for PROCOMM PLUS.
Five terminal attributes are supported: normal, bold, low, reverse and
underline.  The five attributes are provided in order to support the differing
display characteristics of the numerous terminals that PROCOMM PLUS emulates.
For example, the low attribute is used for half intensity as well as write
protected fields in TeleVideo and Wyse emulations.  Note that not all
attributes are available with each emulation.

To change an attribute, press the key corresponding to that attribute.  Then
enter the number of the color you wish to use.  The available colors and their
numbers are displayed on the lower half of the screen to aid you in your
selection.

Under some conditions, the selected terminal colors may be changed under
control of the remote system.  Many BBS systems use ANSI codes to produce
colorful graphic displays, but those codes can also reset your terminal
colors.  Your selected colors will be restored when the terminal type is
reset, or when you exit and return to PROCOMM PLUS.
