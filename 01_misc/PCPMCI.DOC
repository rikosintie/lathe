                               SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

    The PROCOMM PLUS MCI Mail Access System is a series of PROCOMM PLUS
    ASPECT command files which provide a structure for composing, sending
    and retrieving electronic mail messages from MCI Mail.

    The system requires PROCOMM PLUS version 1.1a or above and a modem. 
    Other than that no particular hardware or software is needed.


    SYSTEM FILES

    The system is composed of the following ASPECT command files:

     MCI.ASP        The calling routine, this file performs system
                    initialization.
     PCPMCI1.ASP    The main polling loop which calls the following files.
     PCPMCI2.ASP    This files contains the log-on, message retrieval and
                    message sending routines.
     PCPMCI3.ASP    A simple help facility.
     PCPMCI4.ASP    The routines for creating messages off-line.

    In addition to the files provided above, the system will create the
    following files as needed:

     PCPMCI.IN      Your INBOX, this file contains retrieved messages not yet
                    processed.
     PCPMCI.DSK     Contains messages you have read and processed.  Be sure
                    to purge this file occasionally to keep from getting too
                    large.
     PCPMCI.OUT     Contains a copy of all messages you have sent.  Be to
                    purge it now and then.
     PCPMCI.SND     This file contains messages you have created that have
                    not yet been sent.
     PCPMCI.$$*     Temporary work files.  Should be deleted by the system as
                    you go.  Don't be afraid to delete them if they get left
                    lying around.


    SYSTEM VARIABLES

    The system uses the following string (Sx) and numeric (Nx) variables:

    String Variables

     S0   Selected menu option.
     S1   Addressee (paper message)
     S2   Country        "
     S3   Title/company  "
     S4   Address line 1 ", addressee (instant message)
     S5   Address line 2 ", subject (instant message)
     S6   City           "
     S7   State          "
     S8   Zip code       "
     S9   Subject        "

    Numeric Variables

     N0   Normal color attribute
     N1   Bold color attribute
     N2   Reverse video color attribute
     N3   Flag, 1 = messages found on MCI
     N4   Flag, 1 = download messages
     N5   Flag, 1 = upload messages
     N6   Flag, 1 = log-on only
     N7   Reverse video bold attribute

    ODDS AND ENDS

    There are a couple of things to note here.  For one, the system is
    written to access MCI Mail via Tymnet, as there is not a direct MCI node
    here in Columbia.  However, if there is a direct MCI node in your area,
    you can easily modify the log-on sequence in the file PCPMCI2.ASP to
    accommodate the different log-on process.

    Perhaps the trickiest maneuver being used in the system is located in
    the file MCI.ASP.  If you look about half way down that file you'll see
    the following command lines:

     EMULATE VT102
     TRANSMIT "ATE1^M"
     WAITFOR "OK"
     TRANSMIT "^[[?6h"
     PAUSE 1
     TRANSMIT "^[[4;21r"

    The VT102 terminal has the ability to set a new scroll region, that is
    to redefine the size and position of the terminal "window".  I use the
    code above to reset that region so the system can have the nice looking
    headers and footers, and the text scrolls between them.

    What the code actually does is this:  first we select VT102 as the
    terminal type, as it supports the scroll region.  Then we set the modem
    so that it echoes commands sent to it (ATE1).  Then we send the terminal
    control sequence to set a new origin, which is echoed back by the modem
    then process by PROCOMM PLUS.  Then we do the same thing to set a new
    scroll region.

    This process seems to work OK on most modems, but I've found at least
    one where it won't due to the way the modem accepts and echoes commands. 
    If this doesn't work on your modem, as indicated by all the nice
    formatting scrolling off the screen, you can easily re-code the thing so
    it doesn't use the boxes when on-line.

    Finally, if you look at the "Q" case in PCPMCI1.ASP, you notice that we
    reset the emulation.  Resetting the emulation, even to the same setting,
    resets all the scroll region stuff to normal.

    Couple of other things to note.  For uploading messages, I use ASPECT
    commands to build several temporary files, then use DOS to string them
    together.  The resultant file, PCPMCI.SND, uses a technique called
    blinking.  Blinking works by building a file containing both service
    commands and the message text, which is then uploaded to MCI via an
    ASCII upload.  This works just fine as MCI Mail supports type ahead. 
    The display looks kinda weird, as the prompts and commands are out of
    sync, but it seems to work just fine, at least via Tymnet.  You might
    want to play around with the ASCII Upload pacing options (MCI.ASP) to
    fine tune it depending upon your machine's clock speed.
                             NECESSARY MODIFICATIONS

    There are several modifications you'll need to make before attempting to
    use the system.  

    In the file MCI.ASP, change the line 

     SET BAUD 1200

    to match the baud rate of your modem and the access method being used.

    In the file PCPMCI2.ASP, change the lines

     MDIAL "xxx-xxxx"
     TRANSMIT "USERID"
     TRANSMIT "PASSWORD"

    to contain your local access number, MCI Mail user ID and MCI Mail
    password.

    An optional modification is to change the use of PCEDIT in PCPMCI1.ASP
    and PCPMCI4.ASP to your favorite text editor.  For example, I use KEDIT
    there which allows me to edit much larger files, and is much more
    powerful than PCEDIT.
                                USING THE SYSTEM

    STARTING THE SYSTEM

    Now you're all set to give it a try.  You can start the system in one of
    two ways: from the DOS command line, or from within PROCOMM PLUS.

    To start it automatically when you begin PROCOMM PLUS, use the command
    line

     PCPLUS /fMCI.ASP

    at the DOS prompt.  To start the system from within PROCOMM PLUS, press
    [Alt-F5], then enter "MCI [CR]".


    THE MAIN MENU

    The system will clear the screen, spend a moment initializing, then
    present you with a menu of options that says

    +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | GET   READ   CREATE   SEND   LOGON   DOS   HELP   QUIT              |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------------+

    Press [G] to call MCI Mail and retrieve your messages.  A message will
    display at the top right of the screen if you have messages in your
    local INBOX.

    Press [R] to read messages you've retrieved and that are waiting in your
    local INBOX.  After reading the messages you'll be prompted to PRINT
    them, DELETE them or return to the main menu.  When you delete your local
    INBOX, the contents are first copied to PCPMCI.DSK so you'll have an
    archive of messages you've received.  Be sure to purge that file
    occasionally.

    Press [C] to create messages to send via MCI Mail.  The system currently
    supports instant and paper messages.  I might add other options if I ever
    have the occasion to need them.  You should be able to add them easily
    using logic similar to that used for the currently support types.

    Press [S] to send messages you've created.  You will be asked whether or
    not to pick up messages while you're on-line.  Press [Y] to do so.

    Press [L] to log on to MCI for an interactive session.

    Press [D] to shell to DOS.  Enter "EXIT [CR]" at the DOS prompt to
    return to PROCOMM PLUS and the system.

    Press [H] to get a little help with the choices.

    Press [Q] to exit the system and return to PROCOMM PLUS.  If you'd rather
    go straight back to DOS, change the EXIT command in PCPMCI1.ASP to QUIT.


    DEBUGGING TIPS

    If you're having difficulty getting the system to work, start by going
    into the files and commenting out the SET DISPLAY OFF commands.  That
    will allow you to see what's going on during log on and other places
    through the system.

    Another tip is to add a SET TRACE ON command at the beginning of the
    trouble spots, which will echo the ASPECT commands to the screen as they
    are executed, hopefully letting you see where the trouble lies.
    The place where I've had the most trouble is during the ASCII upload used
    to send messages.  If you seem to be having problems there, try setting
    the character and line pacing timing up a bit.  This is especially true
    for fast 80286 and 80386 machines.

    Well, that's about it.  Everything else should be pretty self
    explanatory.  Please note that I make no guarantee that any of this will
    work on your system, even though I've been using it successfully for some
    time.  Even if it doesn't work for you, you should be able to cannibalize
    the pieces to put together something on your own.

    Good luck, and happy computing!
