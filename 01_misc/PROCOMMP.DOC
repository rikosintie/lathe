                              ORDERING INFORMATION


    A ProComm registration licenses you to use the product on a regular
    basis.  Registration also includes mailed notification of updates and
    priority support on our private BBS for registered users only.  Users
    need register only one version of ProComm; registration includes licensed
    use of all upgrades.

    Individual registrations for ProComm are available in three forms.  The
    first, registration only, costs $25 and assumes you have already received
    a copy of the program from whatever source.  We do not provide diskettes
    or manuals.  For 35 dollars we offer a combination registration/diskette
    package.  The diskette includes the latest version of ProComm, its
    documentation and various supporting programs and files.  We also offer
    The Works!, which adds a bound paperback manual to the registration and
    diskette.  Copies of The Works! are available for $50.

    In addition, evaluation disks are available at any time for $10.  These
    disks do not include registration.  The fee covers diskette, postage and
    handling.

    Please use the enclosed order form when placing an order.

    ORDERS OUTSIDE THE US: Please use your MasterCard or VISA when ordering,
    or send checks drawn on US banks in US dollars.  We can accept non-US
    currency; however, you must include an additional $5 to cover conversion
    and collection costs.  Please include an additional $5 to cover postage
    on orders of The Works! delivered outside of the US.

                                February 16, 1987

    Quantity discounts and licensing agreements are available to business and
    government entities that wish to use ProComm on multiple machines.

    Purchases of less than 100 copies are considered quantity purchases and
    include the discounts listed below.  Purchases of over 100 copies may be
    handled as quantity purchases or through licensing agreements.

    Licensing agreements are implemented as contracts allowing internal
    duplication and distribution of a specific number of copies.  Technical
    support is provided to a contact in the licensed organization, who then
    provides internal support.

    Purchase orders are only accepted in amounts over $100.  All other orders
    must be prepaid.

    For additional information or for details regarding unlimited licenses,
    please contact Stephen Monaco at (314) 449-7012.


    REG/DISK COMBOs include license to use ProComm on a single machine, a
    diskette containing the current release and documentation, plus an
    individual support ID.

                             PREFACE TO VERSION 2.4



    Quite a number of things have changed for this release, most notably the
    command language.  See the accompanying file PRCM24.NEW for a complete
    list.  Enough has changed that it might be wise to delete your existing
    .PRM files and create a new one.  This may not be necessary in all cases;
    however, if strange things start to occur try that first.

    Our apologies to everyone who has tried to call the BBS and couldn't get
    through.  We are receiving a tremendous volume of calls and the phone is
    always busy.  Please do not call the operator to complain; there are no
    technical problems at present, just lots of callers.  Late in 1986 we
    will be adding a second line for registered users only who will receive
    priority support.

    About support: while we try to answer all the mail, electronic and
    otherwise, that we get, it sometimes takes us a while to get around to
    it.  Especially stuff from non-registered users.  Please be patient, and
    remember that we do not guarantee to provide support of any kind to non-
    registered users.

    About this manual: as the name implies, this is a reference manual
    describing the operation of ProComm.  It is not intended as a tutorial on
    communications in general.  For more general and introductory information
    on communications see:

          Glossbrenner, Alfred.  The Complete Handbook of Personal Computer
          Communications, 2nd edition.  New York: St. Martins Press, 1985.

          edition.  Bowie, Maryland: Robert J. Brady Company.

    WARNING: Version 2.4, like some previous versions, uses an overlay
    structure.  This means that not all of the program is loaded into memory
    at once.  As different sections of the program are required, they are
    read off the disk and into memory.  All of the overlays are kept in the
    executable file PROCOMM.EXE.

    The practical implication of the overlay scheme is that PROCOMM.EXE must
    always be available to read overlays from.  On a floppy system, this
    means that you cannot remove the disk on which PROCOMM.EXE resides from
    the drive on which it was executed.  If you do, the overlay linker
    assumes that the PROCOMM.EXE file is open and residing on the disk, and
    writes an updated file directory onto the disk, thereby overwriting any
    and everything on the diskette.

    Obviously this is not a problem for hard disks.  The solution for floppy
    systems is simply not to remove the PROCOMM.EXE disk from the drive.  You
    can easily change the logged drive (via the Alt-B or CHDIR commands) to
    access files on other drives.

    ProComm 2.4                                                  Introduction






                           1.  I N T R O D U C T I O N



    ProComm is a general purpose program designed to provide easy and
    convenient access to a broad variety of telecommunications tasks.  Most
    of the program is written in the "C" programming language, with some
    assembly language routines for optimum performance.  Included in its
    abilities are the sorts of features one would expect to find in highly
    sophisticated telecommunications software:

          *  the ability to emulate a number of popular terminals;

          *  a dialing directory containing one hundred entries;

          *  automatic redial facilities for connecting with hard to reach
          numbers;

          *  several popular file transfer protocols including XMODEM,
          Kermit, Telink and more;

          *  command files to control automatic logon and unattended
          operation;

          *  a DOS gateway which allows you to execute DOS commands or other
          programs while you are still on line;

          *  a host of additional features, including keyboard macros, disk
          and printer logging and many others covered in detail on the
          following pages.


    Hardware Requirements

    ProComm requires a minimum of 130K of available RAM to execute
    properly--that is, 130K in addition to the operating system and any
    resident programs, including such memory resident programs as SideKick,
    SuperKey, etc.  If you are operating with less than 192K total RAM,
    ProComm might not be able to load.  It runs under MS-DOS on the IBM PC,
    XT, AT or any close compatible, and may be used with color, composite or
    monochrome displays.

    Because ProComm may have a relatively large  number of files open at
    once, you must assure that the FILES parameter in your CONFIG.SYS file is
    large enough to accommodate them.  We suggest using FILES=20 (or larger).
    Your DOS manual can give you more information on the CONFIG.SYS file, or
    see the Host Mode section of this manual.

    In addition, of course, you must have a working modem.  The default
    settings in ProComm are all established for Hayes compatible modems.  If
    your modem is not fully Hayes compatible, consult your modem owner's
    guide for details on switch settings, commands, and so forth.  In order
    for ProComm to work correctly, particularly in Host Mode, your modem's
    Carrier Detect (CD) must be set to follow the true state of the carrier,


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      101
    ProComm 2.4                                                  Introduction


    not forced true (or "high") by dip-switch settings.  Similarly, the CD
    should not be set to follow DTR ("Data Terminal Ready") but rather to
    follow the "true state" or "RS-232 Convention" (or however your owner's
    manual state it).  And finally, DTR should not be forced high by dip-
    switch settings; it, too, should follow real state.


    ProComm Files

    When it is first loaded, ProComm creates several files which it will use
    on subsequent operation:

          PROCOMM.PRM, the default parameter file;

          PROCOMM.DIR, a dialing directory file;

          PROCOMM.KEY, a keyboard macro file;

          PROCOMM.XLT, the translate table file;

          PROCOMM.HST, the Host Mode audit trail;

    In addition, if you plan to use the Host Mode, you might want to create a
    file called PROCOMM.MSG, which holds the Host Mode welcome message.


    The ProComm Environment Variable

    ProComm can use the environment variable PROCOMM= to tell it where to
    look for its files.  ProComm first searches the current directory for
    necessary files.  If the files are not there, then ProComm will search
    through the directory pointed to by PROCOMM= (if it exists).  If the
    files are found in neither place, and must be created, they will be
    created in the directory pointed to by PROCOMM=.  If the environment
    variable is not set, files will be created by default in the current
    directory.

    You can set the environment variable by issuing the DOS command

          SET PROCOMM=pathname <CR>

    where "pathname" is a fully qualified path name ending with a backslash.
    You may issue this command either from the command line or from a batch
    file.  For example, if you have the command

          SET PROCOMM=C:\COMM\ProComm\

    in your AUTOEXEC file,  ProComm will know to look for its files in the
    C:\COMM\ProComm subdirectory, and you can use the program from anywhere
    on your system and still have just one set of ProComm files.  Be sure to
    remember to end the pathname with a backslash (\), or ProComm will get
    confused and have problems reading the necessary files.

    You can clear the environment variable null with the command

          SET PROCOMM=  <CR>

    Consult your DOS manual for more information on environment variables.

                        2.  G E T T I N G   S T A R T E D



    You begin a ProComm session by issuing the command

          ProComm [/S] [/B] [/Ffilename] [/M] [/D]

    where /S indicates sound effects, /B indicates black and white operation,
    /Ffilename indicates a command file, /M indicates screen display mode,
    and /D indicates the presence of dual monitors.  (Commands that are
    displayed in square brackets, e.g. [/S], are optional).

    Command line switches are optional, and may appear in any order. They
    must, however, be separated by at least one blank space.

          Including a "/S" on the command line suppresses ProComm produced
          sound effects.  It does not, however, affect beeps (^G) coming from
          the remote computer or the alarm function, nor does it control the
          modem speaker.  You can change the default sound settings after you
          have loaded ProComm by using the General SetUp option of the SetUp
          screen (Alt-S).

          The "/B" option may be used to run the program in black and white.
          This feature is useful if you have a composite monitor attached to
          a color graphics display card.  Specifying "/B" will tell ProComm
          to use only black, white and high intensity white for all displays.
          If the "/B" command line switch is omitted, ProComm will adjust
          itself for either color or monochrome operation.  To make black and
          white colors the default, begin a ProComm session using the "/B"
          option, then save the current colors using the Alt-Z (set colors)
          facility.

          Specify "/F" with a filename to execute a command file immediately
          after loading ProComm.  For example, to execute the command file
          "EXAMPLE.CMD" as the first thing ProComm does after loading, enter

               ProComm /Fexample.cmd <CR>

          Command files are described in detail in Section 7.

          The "/M" option tells ProComm to perform screen displays using BIOS
          calls rather than writing directly to the screen buffer.  This
          option is useful for running ProComm under multi-tasking operating
          systems.  The screen write method is also selectable through the
          SETUP (Alt-S) facility.

          The "/D" option is used when you have both a color and a monochrome
          display connected to your computer.  This option may cause erratic
          behavior if used in conjunction with an EGA card/monochrome monitor
          combination.

    When the program begins it displays the ProComm logo and copyright
    notice.  The first few times you use ProComm the program information

    screen will also appear.  Once you have read the information screen,
    press any key to continue.  You can also display the program information
    screen by pressing Alt-I from Terminal Mode.

    WARNING: Version 2.4, like some previous versions, uses an overlay
    structure.  This means that not all of the program is loaded into memory
    at once.  As different sections of the program are required, they are
    read off the disk and into memory.  All of the overlays are kept in the
    executable file PROCOMM.EXE.

    The practical implication of the overlay scheme is that PROCOMM.EXE must
    always be available to read overlays from.  On a floppy system, this
    means that you cannot remove the disk on which PROCOMM.EXE resides from
    the drive on which it was executed.  If you do, the overlay linker
    assumes that the PROCOMM.EXE file is open and residing on the disk, and
    writes an updated file directory onto the disk, thereby overwriting any
    and everything on the diskette.

    Obviously this is not a problem for hard disks.  The solution for floppy
    systems is simply not to remove the PROCOMM.EXE disk from the drive.  You
    can easily change the logged drive (via the Alt-B or CHDIR commands) to
    access files on other drives.


    Terminal Mode

    After the opening display and the program initialization, you are left in
    Terminal Mode.  Most of your communicating will take place here.  The
    bottom line of the screen is reserved as a status line, but the rest of
    the screen is open for use.  When you first enter Terminal Mode, the
    screen will be blank except for the status line at the bottom of the
    screen:

         +------------+--------+-----+-------+----------+-------+--+--+
         |ALT F10 HELP|ANSI-BBS| HDX |300 N81|LOG CLOSED|PRT OFF|CR|CR|
         +------------+--------+-----+-------+----------+-------+--+--+

    This line indicates the current status of several of ProComm's features:

          ALT F10 HELP indicates that you can press Alt-F10 to activate the
          ProComm Help Screen.  This section of the status line also
          indicates what is currently occurring.  For example, if you
          activate the screen dump, then the words "SCREEN DUMP" will replace
          "ALT F10 HELP".

          The next segment of the status line ("ANSI-BBS") indicates the
          currently activated terminal emulation.

          The third status indicator is for duplex: "HDX" indicates half-
          duplex; "FDX" indicates full-duplex.

          In the fourth block the status indicator reflects the modem line
          settings, in this case 300 baud, no parity, 8 data bits, and 1 stop
          bit.

          The LOG status indicates whether you have activated the feature
          which allows "logging" incoming data directly to disk.  If that
          feature is active, then the indicator will say "LOG OPEN".

    ProComm 2.4                                               Getting Started



          ProComm allows the option of sending incoming data directly to your
          printer; if you select this option, then the printer status
          indicator will say "PRT ON"; otherwise it remains at "PRT OFF".

          If you activate the feature which adds a line feed to all incoming
          carriage returns, the next indicator will show "CR-LF"; otherwise
          it remains at just "CR".

          Similarly, the final item indicates the status of the CR/CR-LF
          output feature.

    Most ProComm features are called from Terminal Mode and are executed in a
    window which leaves your original screen intact.  Press Alt-F10 to
    display a help screen which lists all available commands.  You may select
    commands either from the help screen or directly from Terminal Mode.  You
    can return to Terminal Mode from most windows by pressing <ESC>.


    Terminal Emulations

    Most keyboard and screen functions will operate locally as you expect
    them to.  What they do on the remote computer depends on which terminal
    emulation you are using.  ProComm supports ten popular terminal
    configurations:

       - IBM 3101               - DEC VT-100             - DEC VT-52
       - Televideo 910/920      - Televideo 925/950      - Wyse 100
       - Lear Siegler ADM-3/5   - Heath/Zenith 19        - ANSI-BBS
       - ADDS Viewpoint

    Appendix A contains a complete list of the functions supported for each
    terminal.

    To change the emulation currently in use, select the Terminal SetUp
    option from the main SetUp screen (Alt-S), or use the Emulate command in
    a command file.


    Line Settings

    ProComm supports a variety of communications configurations.  You may
    select the baud rate, number of data and stop bits, parity, and duplex.
    The program defaults to 300 baud operation, with 8 data bits, 1 stop bit,
    no parity and full duplex (echo off).

    Use the Alt-P (Line Settings) command to review or change the active line
    control settings.  After opening the Line Settings window, ProComm
    displays the current settings.  Enter a number from 1 to 12 to change to
    a predefined setting.  Use the numbers 13 through 19 to set up a
    customized configuration.  Enter 20 to select COM1 as your active port,
    21 to use COM2, 22 for COM3, and 23 for COM4.

    Use the Save option (24) to make the new configuration your default. If
    you change the parameter settings without saving them to disk, they will
    be used only for the current session, and will return to their original
    settings the next time you use ProComm.

    Once you have made your selections, press <ESC> to return to Terminal
    Mode. The new parameters are now in effect.


    String Translation

    There are a number of situations in which ProComm will translate strings
    going to or coming from the modem. The strings that are translated
    include the modem initialization string, the modem command, dialing
    directory numbers, long distance codes, keyboard macros, modem connect
    messages and several script commands.  The translation allows you to send
    carriage returns, escape codes and other control characters to the modem,
    as well as providing a pause feature.  ProComm translation characters can
    be specified in the General SetUp screen.  Translation characters are
    provided for CR, ESC, CTRL-char and pause.

    The default CR translation character is the exclamation point ("!").
    Anytime ProComm encounters the CR translation character in one of the
    strings mentioned above, it replaces that character with a CR (ASCII 13).
    To send the character without translation use two of them together.  For
    example, when "!" is the CR translate character, a keyboard macro set to
    "PASSWORD!" sends the string "PASSWORD" followed by a carriage return.  A
    keyboard macro set to "GO AWAY!!" will be translated as "GO AWAY!".
    Since two of these characters in a row are translated as the true
    character, some other method is necessary to send two adjacent carriage
    returns.  You can do so by using the CTRL-char translation described
    below.  For example, if the CTRL translate character is set to the caret
    ("^") the string "^M^M" is translated as 2 carriage returns (because
    Ctrl-M is a CR).

    The default ESC translation character is the vertical bar ("|").  When
    ProComm encounters this character in one of the translated strings, it
    replaces it with an ESC (ASCII 27).  Again, to send the character without
    translation use two of them together.  For example, when "|" is the ESC
    translation character, a keyboard macro set to "|[2J" sends the VT100
    command for clear screen (ESC [ 2 J).  A keyboard macro set to "|| box
    ||" will be translated as "| box |". Again, since two consecutive
    translation characters are translated as the true character, some other
    method is necessary to send two adjacent escapes.  As with the CR
    translation character, you can indicate two consecutive escapes by using
    the CTRL-char translation described below.  If, for example,  the  CTRL
    translation character is set to the caret ("^") the string "^[^[" is
    translated as 2 escapes (because Ctrl-[ is an ESC).

    The CTRL character translation is slightly different.  It is used as a
    lead-in marker to indicate that the following character should be
    interpreted as a CTRL character. For example, using the default CTRL
    translate character "^" (the caret), the string "^C" would be interpreted
    as a Ctrl-C (ASCII 3).  Again, two translation characters together are
    treated as the actual character, so "^^C" would be translated as "^C"
    (the caret character followed by a capital C).

    The final translation character provided is the pause.  If this character
    is encountered during translation, ProComm will pause for 1/2 second
    before doing anything else.  The default translate pause character is the
    tilde ("~").  This translation character is significantly different from
    the others in that two pause characters together cause a 1 second pause,
    three together cause a one and one-half second pause, and so forth.

    Multiple pause translation characters are not interpreted as a single
    character. If you wish to actually send that character (e.g. the tilde)
    you must change the setup for the pause translation character.

    It is important to note the difference between the translation pause
    character and a modem pause character. The translation pause character
    causes a pause in characters being sent to the modem.  This character is
    appropriate for pauses around a modem escape code, as in a hang-up
    string, or for allowing the modem to respond to something before
    continuing.  On the other hand, a modem pause character, such as the
    comma used by Hayes, causes a pause in characters sent from the modem to
    the phone line.  It is appropriate for such tasks as waiting for a second
    dial tone when dialing out through a PBX or office telephone system.  The
    translation pause character and the modem pause character are not the
    same and should not be confused.


    Help Screen

    The Help Screen lists the command keystrokes used to execute a ProComm
    feature. The Help Screen is displayed when you press Alt-F10 while in the
    Terminal Mode.  Pressing Alt-F10 produces this screen:

    You can select any of these features from the Help Screen or directly
    from Terminal Mode.  The Help Screen is merely a help, not a required
    step for reaching the options, nor do you need to return to the Terminal
    Mode before selecting one of the options.  Each of the features listed in
    the Help Screen is described in more detail in Section 4, and many are
    considered in still greater detail in other sections of this manual.  You
    can return directly to Terminal Mode from the Help Screen by pressing any
    non-command key.


    Exiting ProComm

    You can exit ProComm at any time from Terminal Mode or the Help Screen by
    pressing Alt-X.  You will be asked to confirm the decision to leave;
    press "Y" to exit or "N" to resume work.

    ProComm allows you to define many of your own power-up defaults for
    system parameters.  You can also change a setting temporarily, use it for
    the current session, then automatically go back to your default settings
    for the next session.  Setup is reached via the Alt-S command.  It is
    divided into 6 sections: Modem Setup, Terminal Setup, Kermit Setup,
    General Setup, Host Mode Setup and ASCII File Transfer Setup.

    Press Alt-S from the Help Window or while in Terminal Mode to activate
    the SetUp facility.  The screen will clear and present you with these
    options:

                            1)  MODEM SETUP
                            2)  TERMINAL SETUP
                            3)  KERMIT SETUP
                            4)  GENERAL SETUP
                            5)  HOST MODE SETUP
                            6)  ASCII TRANSFER SETUP
                            S)  SAVE SETUP TO DISK

    You can exit the main setup screen at any time by pressing <ESC>; any
    changes you have made but not saved to disk (using the "S" option from
    this screen) will be in effect only for the current ProComm session.

    Select a setup section by typing its number and pressing <CR>.  The
    screen will clear and display the current settings for that section.  To
    change a setting, enter the number of the setting you wish to change and
    press <CR>.  Then make your change as described below.  If, after
    selecting a parameter, you decide not to change it, you can retain the
    current value by simply pressing <ESC>.

    If the parameter you have selected requires a string, type in the
    characters for the new string and press <CR>.  Note that pressing <CR>
    without typing any characters will clear the setting; if you wish to
    retain the current string, press <ESC>.

    Some parameters offer you a selection of valid values.  Press the space
    bar to cycle among the available values.  When the value you desire is
    displayed, press <CR> to accept it.

    If the setting you are changing requires a number, enter the new number
    and press <CR>.  ProComm will check to make sure that the number falls
    within a valid range.  If you have selected a number outside that range,
    ProComm will inform you of the error and allow you to select another
    number.

    After making your changes in a particular section, press <ESC> to return
    to the main SetUp Menu.  If you wish to save your changes to disk, select
    "S" from that menu.  If you choose the Save option, the current settings
    will become your power-up defaults.  If you do not save the setup, the

    changes you have made will be in effect for only the current ProComm
    session.


                                   Modem SetUp


    If you select option 1 from the main SetUp Menu, a screen similar to the
    following will appear:

          -----------------------+ MODEM SETUP +-----------------------

          -------------------------------------------------------------
          OPTION ->                                            ESC Exit

    You may change these options by typing the appropriate selection number.


    1) Modem init string

    The modem initialization string is sent to the modem every time you begin
    a ProComm session, and again whenever you exit Host Mode.  It can be up
    to 46 characters in length, and may contain carriage returns or control
    characters using the translate conventions described in Section 2.  Modem
    initialization strings vary among different types of modems.  The
    default, configured for Hayes or compatible modems, is 'AT E0 S7=60
    S11=55 S0=0 V1 X1!', where

          AT is the command prefix

          E0 sets modem echo of commands off

          S7=60 sets the maximum wait time for a carrier at 60 seconds

          S11=55 sets touch tone spacing (and is very fast)

          S0=0 turns off the modem's auto answer feature

          V1 activates verbal result codes

          X1 activates the extended result codes

          ! causes ProComm to send a CR to the modem at the end of the modem

          initialization string.

    Be sure to include that last "!" if you need ProComm to send a CR at the
    end of the command.

    The initialization string may be tailored to suit your particular modem
    and needs.  Consult your modem user's guide for details regarding the
    operation and available commands for your modem.


    2) Dialing command

    The dialing command is used to instruct the modem to dial a number.  It
    is sent to the modem by the Dial (Alt-D) and Redial (Alt-R) functions,
    followed by the number to dial and any long distance codes you might
    specify.  The default is 'ATDT' where

          AT is the command prefix

          D is the dial command

          T turns on touch tone dialing  (P is used for pulse dialing)

    The modem dialing command may contain imbedded pauses, CRs, ESCs and CTRL
    characters using the conventions on string translation described in
    Section 2.


    3) Dialing cmd suffix

    The dialing command suffix is sent to the modem at the end of a dialing
    command to indicate that the command is complete.  The default command is
    "!", which is translated as a CR, and should be correct for most modems.

    A complete dialing command includes the Dialing Command, the telephone
    number to be dialed (and any associated codes or numbers), and the
    Dialing Command Suffix.  A local call using tone dialing, for example,
    might look like 'ATDT 123-4567!' where

          ATDT is the dialing command

          123-4567 is the number being dialed

    and

          ! (translated as a CR) is the dialing command suffix


    4) Connect string

    The connect string is the message your modem sends to ProComm to indicate
    that a connection has been made.  The default is "CONNECT".  ProComm uses
    this value during automatic redial (Alt-R) to determine when a connection
    has been made.  Note that this parameter must be set correctly (including
    upper- or lower-case) for auto redial to work.  Translation is in effect
    for this string.  For example, if your modem sends '<LF><LF><CR>' to
    indicate CONNECT (as the IBM PCjr modem does), set the Connect String to
    '^J^J^M'.  (A Ctrl-J is a LF, and a Ctrl-M is a CR).

    5) - 8) Modem No Connect strings

    These strings are also used by the auto redial feature.  They should be
    set to modem messages that indicate that a connection was not achieved.
    The defaults are "BUSY", "VOICE" and "NO CARRIER"; a fourth message may
    be added by selecting option number 8.  Again, these strings must be
    exact matches to the messages your modem displays, including upper and
    lower case.  Some modems do not support these call progress monitoring
    features, although most support at least "NO CARRIER".


    9) Hang-up string

    The hang-up string is the command sent to the modem to cause it to hang
    up.  When Alt-H (Hangup) is pressed, ProComm first attempts to hang-up by
    dropping the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) line.  If that attempt fails
    (determined by checking Carrier Detect [CD]), ProComm will send the
    hang-up string to the modem.  The default, set up for Hayes and
    compatible modems, is "~~~+++~~~ATH0!", where

          ~~~  is a 1 1/2 second delay

          +++  is the modem escape sequence to drop into command mode

          ~~~  is another 1 1/2 second delay

          AT is the modem command prefix

          H0 is the hang-up command

          !  sends a <CR>

    The "~" and "!" characters are translated by ProComm, not the modem (see
    Section 2 on string translation for information about how to change these
    characters).  The "+++" surrounded by the 1 1/2 second pauses causes the
    modem to go into command state, where the hang-up command is then issued.
    For more information see the Alt-H command, in Section 4.


    10) Redial Timeout Delay

    This command determines the number of seconds that ProComm will wait
    during Redial (Alt-R) for a Connect or No Connect response from the
    modem.  If the timeout delay is exceeded before a modem response is
    received, ProComm will cycle and attempt another redial.  You should be
    sure that your modem's timeout value is set higher than this timeout
    value, or strange results may occur.

    This value may also be modified on the fly during a redial attempt.  See
    Section 5 on Redialing for more details.


    11) Redial Pause Delay

    The redial pause delay is the number of seconds that ProComm will pause
    between each dialing attempt during a redial.  The pause is provided to


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      304
    ProComm 2.4                                              The Setup Screen


    let the modem settle down between calls.  The default is 2 seconds, and
    the minimum pause time is 1 second.


                                 Terminal SetUp


    When you select the Terminal SetUp option (number 2), you will be
    presented with a screen similar to the following:

          --------------------+  TERMINAL SETUP +----------------------

          1) Terminal emulation ... ANSI-BBS 10) Enquiry .......... OFF
          2) Duplex ............... HALF     11) Break Length (ms). 350
          3) Flow Control ......... NONE
          4) CR translation (in) .. CR
          5) CR translation (out) . CR
          6) BS translation ....... DEST
          7) BS Key definition .... BS
          8) Line wrap ............ OFF
          9) Scroll ............... ON

          ------------------------------------------------------------
          OPTION ==>                                          ESC Exit

    Select a parameter to change by entering its number followed by <CR>.


    1) Terminal Emulation

    Terminal emulation means using your computer to act like a terminal.  Use
    this parameter to select the terminal you wish to emulate.  All of
    ProComm's terminal emulations are described in detail in Appendix A.

    After selecting option 1, press the space bar until the terminal you wish
    to use is displayed.  Then press <CR> to make that terminal the current
    emulation.  Take care to insure that the rest of the settable terminal
    parameters match what is expected for the terminal type you select.  The
    DEC VT100 is the most popular terminal emulation for our users.  For
    general BBS work, we suggest ANSI-BBS.


    2) Duplex

    You can control the default duplex setting here.  Your choices are full
    duplex (no echo) and half duplex (local echo).  The system administrator
    of the system you are calling can tell you what is appropriate for a
    particular system.

    In general, if what you type is not displayed on the screen, but should
    be, try going to half duplex.  If you see two of every character you type
    (e.g., "ttwwoo  ooff  eevveerryy  cchhaarraacctteerr"), change to full
    duplex.  Duplex may also be changed on-the-fly using the Alt-E command.


    3) Flow control

    Flow control (sometimes called "handshaking") is a method computers use


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      305
    ProComm 2.4                                              The Setup Screen


    to control the way they talk back and forth.  It's similar to a traffic
    light in that it determines in which direction traffic can flow at what
    time.  The only flow control that ProComm currently supports is XON/XOFF,
    so your choices for this parameter are XON/XOFF or NONE.  If you wish to
    use flow control set this option to XON/XOFF; otherwise select NONE.
    ProComm performs XON/XOFF at the interrupt level.  To prevent deadlock
    because of extraneous XOFFs caused by line noise, ProComm allows you to
    reset the XOFF flag.  If you see a message on the status line that
    indicates that an XOFF was received, but you think it is not valid, press
    <ESC> to clear the XOFF flag and allow you to continue work.


    4) CR translation (in)

    This feature is used to set the power-up default for incoming carriage
    return translation.

    ProComm needs a CR/LF sequence to correctly handle lines sent to it by a
    remote.  The CR (carriage return) moves the cursor to the beginning of
    the current line, and the LF (line feed) moves it to the next line.  Some
    systems send only a CR and expect you to provide the line feed, while
    others send both the CR and LF.

    When set to CR, ProComm leaves incoming carriage returns alone, and
    assumes that the remote system will also send a LF.  When set to CR/LF,
    ProComm automatically adds a LF to any CR received.  If the lines coming
    from the remote write on top of each other, you need to set this
    translation to CR/LF.  IF lines appear to be double spaced, go to CR.

    Most TTY (non-full screen) applications (including most BBS's) send both
    the carriage return and line feed, so the ProComm default is CR.  You can
    change this setting on-the-fly without affecting the power up default by
    using the Alt-F3 command.


    5)  CR translation (out)

    Just as different systems send different line end sequences, they also
    may need to receive different line end sequences.  Some systems need only
    a CR, while others must have a CR/LF combination.

    Use this option to set the ProComm power up default for outgoing carriage
    return translation.  If set to CR, outgoing carriage returns send only
    the CR.  If set to CR/LF, any carriage return sent by ProComm to the
    remote unit will have a line feed appended to it.

    The ProComm default is to send the CR only.


    6) BS translation

    A backspace (BS) may need to be interpreted differently depending upon
    the terminal emulation in use.  In most cases it is "destructive" (DEST);
    that is, the cursor will both move to the left and delete the character
    in that position when the BS key is pressed or a BS is received from the
    remote.  In other cases, the VT100 for instance, the BS behaves like a
    cursor-left command, merely moving the cursor without erasing any
    characters; it is thus "non-destructive" (NON-DEST).  You may choose the


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      306
    ProComm 2.4                                              The Setup Screen


    correct behavior for your application using this parameter.  The ProComm
    default is DEST.


    7) BS key definition

    Normally, when the backspace key is pressed it sends a BS (ASCII 8) to
    the remote unit; by using this option, however, you can force ProComm to
    transmit a delete (DEL, ASCII 127) instead.  The BS key definition option
    is especially useful when the terminal being emulated has a Del key where
    the IBM-PC has its BS key.

    The ProComm default is to send a BS.


    8) Line wrap

    If an incoming line is greater than 80 characters long, it can be handled
    in two different ways.  It may be truncated (cut off) so that characters
    past the 80th are lost, or it may be wrapped around to continue on the
    next line.  This setting controls which method ProComm will use.

    If line wrap is set ON, lines greater than 80 characters in length will
    wrap around and be displayed on the next line.  With line wrap OFF,
    however, lines greater than 80 characters in length will be truncated.

    Since most terminals truncate lines, the ProComm default is line wrap
    OFF.


    9) Scroll

    The scroll parameter controls what happens if ProComm receives a CR (or
    CR/LF) while the cursor is positioned at the bottom line.  If the scroll
    option is set ON, ProComm moves all the lines on the screen up one line
    (losing the top line) and the new line is printed in the blank space at
    the bottom of the screen.  If scroll is OFF, the cursor returns to the
    far left column, and the new line overprints the old.  Normally this
    feature will be set ON (the default), although for some full screen
    applications you may need to inhibit screen scrolling.


    10) Break Length (ms)

    A break is a spacing condition on the line.  It is often used to get a
    remote system's attention.  ProComm uses Alt-F7 (or CTRL-BREAK on IBM
    machines) to signal a break.

    The break length option allows you to set the length (in milliseconds) of
    the break signal.  The default is 350 ms, and is sufficient for most
    systems.


    11) Enquiry (Ctrl-E)

    Some systems send an ENQ control character (Ctrl-E, ASCII 5) and expect
    an identifying sequence to be returned.  If Enquiry is set ON, ProComm
    will respond to an ENQ by sending the keyboard macro assigned to Alt-0.


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      307
    ProComm 2.4                                              The Setup Screen


    If Enquiry is set OFF, the ENQ will be treated as just another character.

    A third option is available for users of the CompuServe Information
    Service (CIS).  CompuServe uses an ENQ to signal the beginning of an
    automatic file transfer.  If you wish to be able to perform automatic
    file transfers using the CompuServe 'B' protocol while logged on to CIS,
    set this option to CIS B.  Be sure, however, that you are not set to CIS
    B while logged onto other systems, or strange results may occur.

    The ProComm default for Enquiry is OFF.


                                  Kermit SetUp


    The Kermit Setup section provides control over a number of Kermit file
    transfer parameters.  After selecting option 3 from the main SetUp Menu,
    you will be presented with a screen similar to the following:


    ----------------------------+ KERMIT SETUP +-----------------------------

     1) Control quote char ... 35  (ASCII)
     2) Maximum packet size .. 90
     3) Pad character ........ 0   (ASCII)
     4) Number of pad chars .. 0
     5) 8th bit quote char ... 38  (ASCII)
     6) Handshake char ....... 0   (ASCII)
     7) End of line char ..... 13  (ASCII)
     8) File type ............ BINARY

    We do not have the space here to give a Kermit tutorial.  If you do not
    know what these elements are, you probably should not change them.
    Consult the system administrator for your system if you have any
    questions regarding their Kermit installation.

    One parameter worth mentioning is the Handshake character (option 6).  In
    most implementations you should use the default of 0, which implies no
    handshaking.  In the case of line at a time (not full screen) IBM
    mainframe access in half duplex, a handshake value of ASCII 17 is
    appropriate.

    A further discussion of ProComm's Kermit implementation is available in
    the file transfer section, Section 6.

    Selecting the General Setup option from the main SetUp Menu will cause
    the following screen to appear:

    OPTION =>                                                        ESC Exit


    1) Editor name

    Use this parameter to name the program to be accessed by the Alt-A
    (Editor) command.  Pressing Alt-A will execute this program from within
    ProComm, without the necessity of popping out through the DOS Gateway or
    exiting ProComm.  This is very handy for editing or listing a file while
    online, as well as for developing ProComm command files and many other
    tasks.

    The Editor name parameter can be specified in a number of ways. It may be
    a complete filename with path (e.g. C:\WP\EDIT\EDITOR.EXE), just the
    program name without extension (e.g. EDITOR) or anything in between.  If
    no path is specified, ProComm will search the directories specified in
    the environment variable PATH for the indicated program.

    ProComm can run almost any .EXE or .COM program using this feature as
    long as there is enough memory available.  Keep in mind that ProComm
    itself requires approximately 130K of RAM, and the operating system
    another 17-30K (depending on the version).  Other resident programs (such
    as SideKick) can take up even more.  If you are running only 192K (the
    minimum possible to operate ProComm), you may not have enough memory to
    load the desired program unless it is quite small.

    The Alt-A command cannot be used to execute a batch (.BAT) file.


    2) Default d/l path

    This option allows you to specify where you want to put files that you
    download.  If no path is specified, downloads will be directed to the
    currently logged drive and directory.  If a path is specified, the file
    will be placed in the named directory.  For example, if this option is
    set to

          C:\COMM\PROCOMM\DL\

    then all files that you download will be placed in the \COMM\PROCOMM\DL
    directory on drive C:.  Keep in mind that the pathname must end with a
    backslash ("\") in order for ProComm to interpret it correctly.  Consult
    your DOS user's guide for details about directory naming conventions.


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      309
    ProComm 2.4                                              The Setup Screen



    You can override the download directory option when using the file
    transfer protocols which require you to name the incoming file (XMODEM,
    YMODEM, and ASCII).  To do so, include a path when specifying the
    filename to download.  For example, when downloading a file using the
    XMODEM protocol, ProComm will prompt you for the name of the file to be
    downloaded.  If you specify

          C:\BASIC\FILENAME.EXT

    as the filename, the file will go directly to the \BASIC directory on the
    C: drive, and not to the default download directory.  The other file
    transfer protocols include the filename as part of the data being sent,
    so you will not be prompted for the filename to use and thus cannot
    override the default download directory option.


    3) Default log file

    When you activate file logging (Alt-F1), ProComm will prompt you for the
    name of the log file to use.  Pressing <CR> without naming a file directs
    the log to the default file.  Use this parameter to set the default name
    for the log file to use when file logging is in effect.  If the file
    exists, ProComm will not overwrite existing data; rather, new data will
    be appended to the end of the file.  If the file does not exist it will
    be created in the current directory and the data will be saved to it.


    4) Screen dump file

    This option names the file to which ProComm will append screen dumps
    (Alt-G).  If the screen dump file does not exist when Alt-G is pressed,
    it will be created in the current directory.  Again, ProComm will not
    overwrite an existing file, but will append the screen dump data to the
    end of an existing file.


    5) Screen write method

    ProComm can use either of two different methods to perform its screen
    writing.  In the first method, characters are written directly to the
    screen buffer memory area.  In the second, characters are written using
    BIOS (operating system) function calls.  Normally you would use direct
    screen writes because they are much faster.  In some cases, however, such
    as under multi-tasking operating systems or when you are using a not-so-
    compatible computer, you might wish to use the BIOS.  The ProComm default
    is to use direct screen writes.  You may also select BIOS mode using the
    "/M" command line option.


    6) Translate table

    This setting controls whether or not ProComm uses the translation table
    to translate, or strip, incoming characters.  Selecting YES causes the
    translate table to be activated immediately, as well as on program
    startup.  ProComm defaults to NO.  The translate table may be defined and
    toggled ON/OFF using the Alt-W command from the Terminal Mode or from the
    Help Screen. The translate table is discussed in more detail later in


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      310

    this manual.


    7) Sound effects

    This option controls the use of ProComm-produced sound effects.  These
    sound effects include the open and close window sounds, as well as some
    other audible feedback.  It does not control the alarm function, sounds
    generated by the modem or beeps (Ctrl-G, ASCII 7) sent from the host
    unit.  Sound effects are ON by default, and may also be controlled using
    the "/S" command line option (see Section 2).


    8) Alarm sound

    This setting controls whether or not the alarm is audible.  The alarm is
    used to indicate the end of file transfers, connects during re-dials and
    other events.  It may also be activated by the ALARM script command.  If
    the alarm sound is ON, these events will trigger a ringing sound which
    will continue for the number of seconds specified by the alarm time
    setting.  If the alarm sound is OFF, the appropriate message will flash
    for the indicated time but will be silent.  By default, alarm sound is
    ON.


    9) Alarm time (secs)

    Use the alarm time setting to determine the time (in seconds) that you
    wish the alarm sound to ring.  If, for example, you want the file
    transfer alarm to ring for two minutes, then set the alarm time to 120.


    10) Exploding windows

    ProComm makes extensive use of windows in its operation.  This option
    controls the manner in which those windows appear.  If you select YES,
    ProComm will use "exploding" windows, i.e. windows that start small and
    rapidly grow to full size.  If, on the other hand, you select NO, then
    windows will appear without expanding frames.  By default ProComm will
    use exploding windows.  This is purely a cosmetic effect, and has no
    bearing on the functionality of the program.


    11) XMODEM mode

    Some remote systems, such as CompuServe, cannot handle the normal XMODEM
    error timeout periods.  They need a less critical timing situation.  For
    these systems, set the XMODEM mode to RELAXED to avoid file transfer
    aborts resulting from timing errors.  In most cases, however, this option
    should be set to NORMAL.


    12) Xlat pause character

    The translate pause character parameter is used to set the character
    which is to be interpreted as a pause during string translation.  ProComm
    uses the tilde (~) as the default.  See Section 2 for more details on
    string translation.

    13) Xlat CR character

    This parameter sets the character which is to be interpreted as a
    carriage return during string translation (the translate CR character).
    By default, an exclamation point (!) is used. See Section 2 for details
    about translation characters.


    14) Xlat CTRL character

    The translate CTRL character parameter is used to set the character which
    is interpreted as signaling a control character during string
    translation.  The default is the caret (^).  Section 2 has more details.


    15) Xlat ESC character

    Use this parameter to set the character which is to be interpreted as an
    ESC during string translation.  By default, ProComm uses a vertical bar
    (|).  See Section 2 on string translation for more details.


    16) Aborted downloads

    This setting will determine the disposition of files that are aborted
    during downloads.  If it is set to KEEP, these partial files are kept on
    the disk and are your responsibility.  If it is set to DISCARD, they are
    erased from your disk when the download aborts.  By default, aborted
    downloads are kept.


    17) Transmit pacing (ms)

    This parameter controls output pacing of strings.  Strings that are paced
    include all the setup strings, macro keys, and terminal control sequences
    such as function keys and cursor control.  This option is provided for
    those systems too slow to handle ProComm's speed.


                                 Host Mode SetUp


    Selecting the Host Mode Setup option from the main SetUp Menu will cause
    the Host Mode SetUp screen to appear:

    ---------------------------+ HOST MODE SETUP +---------------------------

     1) Host ID string ....... Welcome to ProComm Host!
     2) Auto answer string ... ~~~+++~~~ATS0=1!
     3) Host mode password ... PASSWORD

    ProComm 2.4                                              The Setup Screen




    1) Host ID string

    The host ID string is a message that is sent to a remote caller when he
    connects to ProComm in Host Mode.  It can be set to anything you desire.
    Notice that the default message includes a CR translation character (here
    the "!") at the end of the string.


    2) Auto answer string

    The auto answer string can be thought of as a modem initialization string
    for use with the host mode.  Use it to set the modem into auto answer
    mode.  The default string is "~~~+++~~~ATS0=1!", where

          ~~~  is a 1 1/2 second pause

          +++  sets the modem in command state

          ~~~  is another 1 1/2 second pause

          AT is the command prefix

          S0=1 sets the modem to answer after one ring

          ! causes ProComm to send a CR.

    The "~~~" part is a ProComm command rather than a modem command and will
    probably not have to be reset.  The other commands depend on the needs of
    your particular modem.  Consult your modem user's guide for further
    information.


    3) Host mode password

    ProComm Host Mode provides some security by means of access passwords.
    The host mode password must be correctly entered by all remote callers
    before they are granted access to your system.  The caller must match the
    password completely, including upper- and lower-case letters.  If you set
    the password to null, then callers can get through the password prompt by
    pressing <CR> without typing anything else.


    4) DOS shell password

    Callers must know this secondary password to be allowed access to the
    remote DOS shell.  Be very careful about this password; you do not want
    just anyone to have system-level access on your machine.  You should
    definitely not leave the DOS shell password blank, nor should you leave
    it at the default.


    5) Auto baud detect

    Auto baud detect allows ProComm to match the baud rate at which a user
    calls.



    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      313
    ProComm 2.4                                              The Setup Screen


    ProComm provides three choices of auto baud detect in host mode.  The
    first choice is NONE, that is ProComm will not attempt to match baud
    rates with incoming calls.  Users must call at the same rate that ProComm
    is set to in order to be connected.  The second choice, called MODEM MSG,
    uses modem messages to determine baud rate.  Your modem must support the
    messages CONNECT (for 300 baud), CONNECT 1200 and CONNECT 2400 in order
    to use MODEM MSG.  In addition, your modem must be configured to return
    these message.  That configuration is usually achieved via the Xn modem
    command, which may be placed in either the modem initialization string,
    or the auto answer string.  The third choice, known as KEY HIT, requires
    that callers enter several <CR>s (or SPACES if at 2400 baud) in order for
    ProComm to match baud rates.  No modem messages are required.  ProComm
    defaults to KEY HIT.


    6) Connection type

    The connection type determines who ProComm Host Mode is talking to.  When
    set to MODEM, ProComm assumes a modem connection and performs as
    described in the Host Mode section later in this manual.  When set to
    DIRECT, ProComm bypasses the carrier detect process and immediately
    initiates a connection; this feature is useful for direct connecting to
    other computers.


                              ASCII Transfer SetUp


    The ASCII Transfer SetUp Menu is used to determine the characteristics of
    file transfers in the ASCII mode:


    ------------------------+ ASCII TRANSFER SETUP +-------------------------

          ASCII UPLOAD

     1) Echo locally ......... NO
     2) Expand blank lines ... YES

     3) Pace character ....... 0   (ASCII)
     4) Character pacing ..... 15  (1/1000 sec)
     5) Line pacing .......... 10  (1/10 sec)
     6) CR translation ....... NONE
     5) LF translation ....... STRIP

          ASCII DOWNLOAD

     8) CR translation ....... NONE
     9) LF translation ....... NONE

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    OPTION =>                                                        ESC Exit


                                  ASCII UpLoad


    1) Echo locally


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      314
    ProComm 2.4                                              The Setup Screen



    Use this setting to control whether or not ProComm echoes locally what it
    is transferring during ASCII uploads.  In most cases set this to NO and
    let the remote do any desired echoing.  If the remote and ProComm are
    both displaying what is being transferred, you'll have a real mess on
    your screen.


    2) Expand blank lines

    Many systems interpret a blank line to mean "end of text".  This is
    especially true when entering online messages.  Use this option to tell
    ProComm to expand blank lines.  This would allow you to include blank
    lines (for spacing) in messages that you are uploading without the remote
    thinking it is the end of the message.  When set ON, ProComm will add a
    space to lines being uploaded that contain only a CR or CR/LF.  When set
    OFF, lines are uploaded as they exist.  By default ProComm will expand
    blank lines.


    3) Pace character

    The Pace character provides one means of pacing uploaded text.  If the
    pace character is set to a value other than 0, ProComm will send a line,
    then wait to receive the specified character before sending the next
    line.  Enter the decimal value for the ASCII character desired; for
    example, set it to 13 to indicate a carriage return.  ProComm will send a
    line and then wait to receive a CR from the remote before continuing to
    send the next line.  The default is 0, which means that no pace character
    is used.


    4) Character pacing

    Another pacing option that ProComm provides is character pacing.
    Specifying this option causes ProComm to pause after each character has
    been sent during an ASCII upload.  This can help avoid over-running the
    remote computer's input buffer.  If character pacing is set to a value
    other than 0, ProComm will send a character, then wait the specified
    number of milliseconds (1/1000 second) before sending another character.
    By default, character pacing is set at 15 ms.  Character pacing may be
    used in conjunction with any of the other pacing options.


    5) Line pacing

    ProComm can also perform line pacing during ASCII uploads if you so
    desire.  Line pacing is similar to character pacing except that the pause
    occurs after each line, rather than after each character.  After a line
    is sent, the program will wait for the time specified (in 1/10 seconds)
    before sending the next line.  Pacing may be set to zero if the remote
    can handle that speed of transmission.  Line pacing may be used in
    conjunction with character pacing; it is generally not needed if you are
    using a pace character.  The ProComm default for line pacing is 10-tenths
    of a second (i.e., one full second).


    6) CR translation (uploads)


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      315
    ProComm 2.4                                              The Setup Screen



    As discussed above, different systems require different line end
    sequences.  This option controls outgoing carriage return translation
    during an ASCII upload.  You have 3 options.  If CR translation is set to
    NONE, no translation is performed and carriage returns are passed
    directly to the remote.  If set to STRIP, all carriage returns
    encountered in the file being uploaded are stripped, and not sent.
    Finally, if set to ADD LF, a line feed will be added to all outgoing
    carriage returns.  ProComm defaults to NONE.


    7) LF translation (uploads)

    LF translation is similar to CR translation, but affects line feeds.  As
    with CR translation, you have 3 options.  If you select NONE, no
    translation is performed.  If you set LF translation to STRIP, all line
    feeds encountered in the file being uploaded are stripped.  If you set it
    to ADD CR, a carriage return will precede all outgoing line feeds.  The
    default for outgoing LF translation is STRIP.

    You should pay close attention to what is being done with these
    parameters.  On a PC, most text files are delimited by a CR/LF sequence.
    Most mainframe and other systems, however, want to receive ASCII files
    with only a CR as the delimiter.  Thus the ProComm defaults take a file
    containing CR/LF sequences and transmit it as a CR-only delimited file.
    The various combinations available in ProComm will allow you to transfer
    ASCII text files to virtually any system.


                                 ASCII Download


    8) CR translation

    The download CR translation is exactly like that described above only it
    applies to text going in the other direction; it translates CRs coming in
    to ProComm from the remote.  There are three options for controlling
    incoming carriage return translation during ASCII downloads.  If CR
    translation is set to NONE, no translation is performed.  STRIP causes
    all carriage returns encountered in the file being received to be
    stripped, while ADD LF causes a line feed to be added to all incoming
    carriage returns.  The ProComm default is NONE.


    9) LF translation

    This option controls incoming line feed translation during ASCII
    downloads.  It also has 3 options.  If it is set to NONE, no translation
    is performed.  If it is set to STRIP, all line feeds encountered in the
    file being downloaded are stripped, and if it is set to ADD CR, a
    carriage return will be added in front of all received line feeds.  NONE
    is the default translation.

    Once again the variety of ASCII translation options will allow you to
    receive ASCII text files from any system in a format suitable for your
    PC.

    After the opening display and the program initialization, you are left in
    Terminal Mode.  The bottom line of the screen is a status line, but the
    rest of the screen is open for use.  Most of your communicating takes
    place in Terminal Mode, and most ProComm commands are executed from there
    as well.  Commands are usually executed in a window which leaves your
    original screen intact.

    Commands are activated by pressing certain keystrokes while in Terminal
    Mode.  You may, however, get a listing of available commands by pressing
    Alt-F10, the Help key.  You can then execute commands directly from the
    Help Screen without returning to the Terminal Mode.  Pressing any non-
    command key will return you to Terminal Mode.

    The Help Screen lists all of the major ProComm features, divided into
    three blocks: Major Functions, Utility Functions, and File Functions.


                                 Major Functions


    Dialing Directory

    Pressing Alt-D activates the dialing directory. The dialing directory is
    an online phone list which contains up to 100 entries and various
    information relating to those entries such as baud rate, parity, echo,
    etc.  The functions available from the dialing directory are described in
    detail in Section 5.


    Automatic Redial

    The automatic redial facility (accessed with Alt-R) provides for
    automatic redialing of a single number or a list of numbers.  It is
    especially useful for connecting to hard-to-reach numbers.  Its features
    and how to use them are examined in Section 5.


    Keyboard Macros

    Keyboard macros allow you to assign character strings to the keys Alt-0
    through Alt-9, which may then be used to transmit the assigned string to
    the remote with a single keystroke.  Macro strings may be up to 50
    characters long, and may contain imbedded control codes and carriage
    returns using the translate conventions described in Section 2.  To send
    the string you've assigned, simply press the appropriate key.

    Access the keyboard macro facility by pressing Alt-M from Terminal Mode
    or the Help Screen.  A window will appear listing the current key
    assignments.  To revise an assignment press "R", then the key to assign

    key.  Press <CR> when you are done.  Respond "Y" to the 'OK' prompt to
    accept the assignment; otherwise, it is discarded.  After creating a
    group of macros be sure to save them to disk, using the "S" option,  or
    they will be discarded when you leave the current ProComm session.  Press
    <ESC> to return to Terminal Mode.

    You may create and use any number of keyboard macro files for use with
    different systems.  By default, ProComm will load the file called
    PROCOMM.KEY when it is brought up.  To create other .KEY files, first
    select "C" (clear) to clear out the current macro definitions.  Then use
    the "R" (revise) option as described above to create your new set of
    definitions.  Now choose "S" to save the new definitions.  When prompted
    for a file name, give the name of the file you wish the macro definitions
    to be saved in.  The file may use any valid filename; we suggest using a
    file extension of .KEY to help distinguish the nature its contents.
    Pressing CR without naming a file will cause ProComm to store the macros
    in the default file PROCOMM.KEY.

    To load a new macro file select option "L" (load).  Then give the name of
    the macro file to load.  Again, if you press <CR> without naming a
    specific file, ProComm will use the default (PROCOMM.KEY).  The named
    file will be loaded and the new definitions displayed.  Macro key files
    may also be loaded via the MLOAD script command.

    Multiple macro key files give you considerable flexibility in using
    different systems.  One thing you can do is create different .KEY files
    for various systems that you call, then load the macros via a MLOAD
    command in a script file linked to that system in the dialing directory.
    If you use a consistent scheme (i.e. user ID in Alt-1, password in Alt-2)
    you can simplify many of your online tasks.


    Line Settings

    ProComm supports a wide variety of communications configurations.   You
    may select baud rate, the number of data and stop bits, parity and
    duplex.  The program defaults to 300 baud operation, with 8 data bits, 1
    stop bit, no parity and echo off (full duplex).

    Use the Alt-P command to review or change the active line control
    settings.  After opening the Line Settings window, ProComm displays the
    current settings.   Enter a number from 1 to 12 to change to a predefined
    setting.  Use the numbers 13 through 19 to define a customized
    configuration.  Enter 20 through 23 to make COM1 through COM4 your active
    port.

    The save option (24) is used to make the new configuration your default.
    If you change the line settings without saving them to disk, they will be
    used only for the current session.

    Press <ESC> to return to Terminal Mode, and the new settings will be in
    effect.

    Various systems have different line control needs.  By far the most
    common settings are N/8/1 (no parity, 8 data bits and 1 stop bit) and
    E/7/1 (even parity, 7 data bits and 1 stop bit).  Most bulletin board
    systems (BBS) require N/8/1.  Many mainframe computers use E/7/1.  When


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      402
    ProComm 2.4                                               Major Functions


    calling online services such as CompuServe and The Source via public
    networks like Telenet and Tymnet, be sure to use E/7/1.  A good rule of
    thumb is if you are at N/8/1 and your screen displays a lot of garbage
    (graphics characters and the like), switch to E/7/1.

    An alternative to using E/7/1 on some systems is to use N/8/1 and strip
    the high bit off all incoming characters using the translate table.  To
    do so, set the upper 128 (128-255) characters in the translate table to a
    value exactly 128 less than their ASCII decimal values.  Thus 128 would
    be set to 0, and 255 would be set to 127.


    Translate Table

    ProComm's translate table provides a means for you to strip or replace
    unwanted characters you receive from the remote.  Press Alt-W to display
    the current translation settings.  The table will indicate whether
    translation is currently taking place, as well as showing you the current
    translation values for the ASCII characters 0-127.  Press F2 to display
    translation values for characters 128-255.  Pressing the keys F3 and F4
    will toggle the translation effect on or off.  You may set the default
    condition from the General Setup screen in the Setup menu (Alt-S).

    To change a translation value, enter the decimal ASCII code to reset.
    Now enter the translated value (again in decimal).  To strip an unwanted
    character, translate it to 0.  For example, suppose the system you are
    calling sends a lot of beeps (ASCII 7) and you want to filter them out.
    Bring up the translate table (Alt-W).  Enter a 7 at the 'NUMBER TO
    CHANGE' prompt, and then a 0 at the 'NEW VALUE' prompt.  The change will
    be highlighted in the display.  Now save the table by pressing F1, and
    activate it by pressing F3.  All beeps (ASCII 7) coming from the remote
    will now be stripped out.  Use the same technique to translate a given
    value to something else. Press <ESC> to return to Terminal Mode.

    One important note: when you turn the translate table ON, it reads the
    .XLT file from disk and overwrites the existing table.  Thus you cannot
    make some changes, then turn on the table, since the changes you made
    will be overwritten.  You must either make the changes, save the changes
    and then turn on the table, or turn on the table, and then make your
    changes.  To make the changes effective for only the current session, do
    not save the changes to disk.


    Editor

    To call an editor, word processor or other program from within ProComm,
    press Alt-A.  ProComm will then attempt to load the program you listed as
    the editor name in the General Setup portion of the Setup screen.  You
    can specify any executable program (except batch files) to be called by
    the Alt-A command.  This command is quite useful for viewing a file,
    doing some editing, or whatever.

    In order for this function to work, however, a couple of things must be
    correctly set.  First, COMMAND.COM must reside on the drive you booted
    from. Second, ProComm must be able to find the program you requested.
    (See the discussion on the editor name in the General Setup section).
    Third, your computer must have enough available memory to execute the
    desired program.  There is no default for this feature, so be sure to set

    it up before attempting to use it.


    Exit

    To exit ProComm, press Alt-X.  You will be asked to verify your decision
    to assure that you are not exiting by mistake.  Answer "Y" to exit, "N"
    to continue working.  Be sure that you have saved any setup changes you
    have made and wish to keep before exiting or they will be lost.
    Similarly, be sure you have completed your online tasks and signed off,
    since ProComm will hangup when you exit.


    Host Mode

    ProComm includes a limited Host Mode which allows remote access to your
    computer.  You can activate the Host Mode by pressing Alt-Q.  Host mode
    features password protection, file transfers, operator page and DOS shell
    access.  It can also display a canned message or graphics screen, and
    maintain a history of logons.  Host Mode is described in detail in
    Section 8.


    Chat Mode

    Chat Mode provides split screen operation for online conversations.
    Incoming text (and echoed outgoing text if in full duplex) is displayed
    in the top 18 lines of the screen.  Outgoing text is displayed in the
    bottom 4 lines.

    Activate Chat Mode by pressing Alt-O.  Limited line editing is provided
    for outgoing text; use the backspace key to edit a line before it gets
    sent.  Text is sent to the remote only after a carriage return or when
    the buffer gets full (about 3 full lines of text).  Ctrl-Q and Ctrl-S
    keystrokes (XON and XOFF), however, are sent immediately.

    Printer and disk logging will continue if they are active when Chat Mode
    begins.  The Redisplay facility (Alt-F6) is also available in Chat Mode.
    Press <ESC> to exit Chat Mode and return to the normal Terminal Mode.


    DOS Gateway

    ProComm provides a gateway to DOS which allows you to execute DOS
    commands or other programs without ending the ProComm session.  To
    activate the DOS gateway press Alt-F4.  ProComm uses the COMSPEC
    environment variable to find the command processor, so make sure that
    COMMAND.COM is present on the boot drive, or the gateway will not work
    correctly.  Type "EXIT" on the DOS command line when you wish to return
    to ProComm.

    CAUTION: executing other communications programs through the Gateway may
    cause erratic results when you return to ProComm.  If this occurs, using
    the Alt-P command to reset ProComm's line settings may re-establish the
    connection.


    Command Files


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      404
    ProComm 2.4                                               Major Functions



    Command files are text files containing ProComm commands.  You can use
    command files to perform automatic logons, unattended file transfers, and
    many other tasks.  You can create command files using virtually any word
    processor provided that the program can save files in a "non-document"--
    or straight ASCII--format.  Command files may be executed on program
    startup, from the command file menu (Alt-F5), or by linking them with
    dialing directory entries.  See Section 7 for a complete discussion of
    command files and the ProComm command set.


    Redisplay

    To redisplay lines that have scrolled off your screen, press Alt-F6.
    ProComm will display the last 10000 characters that have come in,
    beginning with the most recent screen.

    You can move through the redisplay buffer in any of several ways:  use
    the PgUp and PgDn keys to scroll one page in either direction; use the up
    and down arrow keys to move one line in either direction.  Pressing the
    Home key will cause the first page of the buffer to display, while
    pressing the End key will display the last page.  To search for specific
    text with the redisplay buffer, press "F" or "/".  A window will open,
    and you will be prompted for the string to search for.  If the string is
    found, ProComm will scroll to the page it is on and highlight it.  To
    search for the same string again, press <CR> when ProComm prompts you for
    the text to look for.  Searches are not case sensitive.


                                Utility Functions


    Program Information

    To display the ProComm program information screen, press Alt-I.  Type any
    key to return to Terminal Mode.


    SetUp Screen

    Use the SetUp option (Alt-S) to access the 6 setup areas: modem setup,
    terminal setup, Kermit setup, general setup, host mode setup, and ASCII
    file transfer setup.  These options are described in detail in Section 3.


    Kermit Server Command

    ProComm provides several Kermit server commands for use with remote
    systems running in Kermit server mode.  Access the command menu by
    pressing Alt-K, then select the desired command from the menu.  See
    section 6 for  more details regarding these commands.


    Change Directory

    You can use the Alt-B command to change the default directory and/or the
    active drive.  To change directories, press Alt-B.  A window will appear
    naming the current drive and directory.  Simply enter the drive

    (including a colon), directory or both and press <CR>.  You have now
    changed the default drive and or directory.  Press <ESC> to leave the
    default unchanged.


    Clear Screen

    Press Alt-C to clear your screen and home the cursor.  This is a local
    effect only.  Clearing the screen will also reset ProComm to its default
    colors, useful when connecting to systems which change colors and don't
    reset them.


    Toggle Duplex

    Pressing Alt-E will toggle ProComm between full and half duplex.  You can
    set the default duplex in ProComm's SetUp (Alt-S) screen.  If characters
    you type appear twice (e.g., "AAppeeaarr  TTwwiiccee") you should set
    duplex to full.  Similarly, if you type something that is not displayed,
    but should be, try toggling duplex to half.  A message is briefly
    displayed on the status line, and the duplex block (the third block on
    the status line) indicates whether you are currently operating under half
    or full duplex ("HDX" or "FDX").


    Hang Up Phone

    Press Alt-H to hang-up your telephone connection.  ProComm will first
    attempt to hangup by dropping DTR (Data Terminal Ready).  If this attempt
    fails, as indicated by the presence of CD, then the modem hang-up string
    will be sent to the modem.  If ProComm is not causing your modem to hang
    up correctly, be sure that your modem does not have DTR or CD forced
    high, and check the hang-up string in the modem SetUp screen (via Alt-S)
    against the string suggested by your modem user's guide.


    Elapsed Time

    Pressing Alt-T will display the current time and date, as well as the
    elapsed time since the last call was made.   Elapsed time is reset every
    time you make a call using the dialing directory or make a connection
    using the automatic redial facility.


    Print On/Off

    Press Alt-L to toggle printer logging on or off. If printer logging is
    toggled on, any information coming from the remote system will be sent
    directly to your printer as well as to your screen. The status of the
    printer log is indicated by the message PRT ON or PRT OFF on the status
    line.


    Set Colors

    Enter Alt-Z from Terminal Mode to set your local screen colors.  A window
    will open with a list of window selections on the left and instructions
    on the right.  Press the up or down arrow keys to select a window to


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      406

    change.  Next, press the left or right arrow keys to choose which part of
    the window to change (background, foreground, or hi-light).  Press the
    space bar to cycle among the color choices.  After you have set all the
    colors you want to change, press <ESC> to exit.  You will then be asked
    if you want to save the color changes to disk.   If you save the changes
    to disk, they will remain until you change them again; otherwise they
    will remain only for the current session.  You can use this last option
    to set the colors temporarily, try them out during a session, then return
    to Alt-Z and save them to disk.

    Some windows do not appear in the window list but are settable anyway.
    The Alt-T (elapsed time), Alt-B (change directory), and Alt-X (exit)
    windows use the same colors as the keyboard macros window.  The redial
    display (Alt-R) uses the phone directory (Alt-D) colors.  The SetUp
    screens (Alt-S) use the help window colors.  Communication screen colors
    are used in the redisplay section and the command file selection window
    (Alt-F5) uses the file transfer window colors.


    Auto Answer

    You may control the auto answer feature of most modems using a software
    command.  For instance, sending the command "ATS0=1<CR>" to a Hayes modem
    tells it to answer the phone on the first ring.  Similarly, the command
    "ATS0=0<CR>" tells that modem to turn auto answer off.

    ProComm allows you to issue an auto answer command at the touch of a
    keystroke.  Pressing Alt-Y causes the string you have specified as the
    auto answer string in the Host Mode section of the SetUp screen to be
    sent to the modem.  Note that this command is used to set the modem into
    auto answer mode; it is not used to command the modem to answer
    immediately.  You could use a command such as "ATA!" in a keyboard macro
    to instruct the modem to answer on command.  See Sections 3 and 8 for
    more information regarding the auto answer string.


    Toggle CR - CR/LF

    Some remote systems delimit lines of text with a single carriage return,
    while others use a carriage return/line feed combination.  ProComm likes
    to receive lines that end with both a CR and a LF.  If necessary, ProComm
    can add a line feed to each incoming carriage return.

    Use Alt-F3 to toggle this feature between CR and CR/LF.  The default is
    CR only, that is, do not add additional LFs.  If text lines overwrite
    each other, the remote is not sending LFs, so switch to CR/LF.  If text
    appears double spaced, try the CR setting.  A message is briefly
    displayed when you toggle this option, and the current setting is
    reflected in the next-to-last block of the status line.  The default
    condition for this option may be set in the Terminal Setup section of the
    SetUp facility.


    Break

    A break is a spacing condition on the line, often used to signal
    attention to the remote.  Pressing CTRL-BREAK will cause the break
    condition to occur.  On some non-IBM machines pressing CTRL-BREAK can


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      407

    cause a lockup; therefore ProComm provides another keystroke, Alt-F7,
    which also causes the break condition to occur.  The default time period
    for a break is 350 milliseconds, but that may be changed via the Terminal
    SetUp screen.  Use the keyboard macro feature if you require that a
    specific character be sent in order for the remote to realize a break.



                                 File Functions


    Send Files (Upload)

    ProComm provides a number of common protocols for use transferring files;
    pressing PgUp will activate the screen listing those protocols and allow
    you to choose among them.  See Section 6 for a detailed description of
    file transfers.


    Receive Files (Download)

    Pressing PgDn activates the download menu screen and allows you to select
    from the available protocols.  See Section 6 for more details on file
    transfers.


    Directory

    Press Alt-F to get a file listing of the currently logged drive or
    directory.  Enter the file specification ("filespec") at the prompt just
    as you would in the DOS DIR command.  Paths and drives are supported.
    COMSPEC must be set correctly for this feature to work.  That is, you
    must have COMMAND.COM on the boot drive, or the Alt-F command will not
    work correctly.


    View a File

    To examine a file that exists on your system type Alt-V.   You will be
    prompted for the name of the file.  Enter the complete filename,
    including drive and path designator if desired.  Use the PgUp and PgDn
    keys to page through the file.  Press Home to go to the beginning of the
    file.  Pressing <ESC> will end the viewing procedure and return to the
    Terminal Mode.  This viewing facility is rather primitive; it is intended
    only as a convenience.  For more complete browsing power, use the Alt-A
    editor command, or drop through the DOS gateway and use your favorite
    list program.


    Screen Dump

    Pressing Alt-G activates a screen dump of the current screen contents.
    Screen contents are appended to the current .IMG file, which may be
    specified in the SetUp screen.  The default screen dump file is
    PROCOMM.IMG.

    ProComm provides two alternatives to file transfer for capturing
    information: file and printer logging.  After initiating the logging
    procedure, any information coming from the remote system is routed to the
    log as well as to the screen.

    Press Alt-L to begin capturing information to your printer.   A message
    on the status line will indicate that the printer log is open.  Pressing
    Alt-L again will toggle printer logging off.

    ProComm writes the logged data to the DOS device PRN.  The default value
    for PRN is LPT1:.  You may use the DOS 'MODE' command to redirect PRN.
    For example, if your printer is on COM1: use the DOS command

          MODE LPT1:=COM1:

    to send printer output there.

    Data can also be captured to disk, using the Alt-F1 command.   Specify
    the name of the file to be used, or press <CR> to use the default file.
    If the file already exists, new information will be appended at the end
    of the file.  Press Alt-F2 (Log Hold) to suspend information capture
    without closing the log file.  A message indicating logging status will
    be displayed on the bottom line of the screen.  Press Alt-F1 again to
    toggle the log file closed.

    With the exception of formfeeds, terminal control sequences are not
    included in the log files.

    The ProComm dialing directory automates most of your dialing tasks.  The
    directory holds information for 100 of your most often-called systems.
    The information includes the name and phone number, as well the
    communications parameters specific to that entry.  Also included in the
    directory is a user definable modem command, with an optional suffix, and
    up to four long distance codes that you can use with alternate
    long-distance services.  You can even link command files to dialing
    directory entries to provide custom setup configurations or to perform
    logon sequences automatically.

    Press Alt-D to access the dialing directory.  A window is opened that
    displays pages of 10 entries at a time:

    The current modem command ("Modem Dial Cmd"), modem command suffix ("Dial
    Cmd Suffix"), active long distance codes ("LD Codes Active") and the
    active port ("Com Port Active") are displayed at the bottom of the
    screen.  The modem command defaults to "ATDT", with "!" (translated as a
    CR) as the suffix.

    Use the PgUp and PgDn keys to display the previous or next page of
    entries.  The up and down arrow keys will scroll the display one entry in
    either direction.  The Home key will position the display at the first
    page in the directory, while the End key will position it at the last
    page.  Press <ESC> to exit the dialing directory.

    Searching for an Entry

    The dialing directory also has a search capability.  To look for a
    particular entry press "F" or "/".  A window will open asking for the
    text to search for.  Enter the string you wish to be found and press
    <CR>.  ProComm will search the name and number fields for the string you
    provided.  If the string is found, the dialing directory will scroll to
    the page containing that entry, and the entry will be highlighted.

    The dialing directory search facility is not case sensitive.  For
    example, a search for the string "abcd" will match "abcd", "ABCD", "AbCd"
    or any other mix of upper- and lower-case characters.  You can even
    search for telephone numbers or even parts of numbers.  (That is, you can
    search for "Phil Sidney", just "Sidney", or "555-1586", or even "1586".)
    If the search routine reaches the end of the dialing directory without
    finding a match, it will wrap around to the beginning of the directory
    and continue its search until it has checked each entry once.  If the
    string is still not found, a message to that effect is displayed.  To
    repeat a search for the same text, press "F" or "/" a second time and
    then immediately press <CR>.


    Revising the Dialing Directory

    When you first use the dialing directory most of the entries will be
    empty.  The name and phone number fields will be filled with periods; the
    default baud rate is 1200, with no parity, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit and
    echo off (full duplex).  You may add a new entry or revise an old one by
    selecting the "R" option.  You may also revise the long distance codes
    (by entering the appropriate LD code identifier: -,+,@,#).  An entry need
    not be displayed on the screen in order to revise it.


    Adding or Revising an Entry

    To add an entry to the directory, or to change an existing entry, enter
    "R" at the "==>" prompt.  A window will open and you will be asked for
    the entry to revise.  Type the entry number (1-100) you wish to revise.
    The current values for that entry are displayed at the top of the window.
    You are prompted first for the name.  Press <CR> to retain the current
    value, or enter up to 24 characters for a new or revised name.  You can
    use the backspace and left arrow keys to edit your entry.  Press <CR>
    when you are done.  You will now be prompted for the phone number.  Enter
    only the numbers you need; the number will be right justified on the
    page.  For example, if you are entering a local number, you need not
    enter spaces for the area code.  Press <CR> when you are finished
    entering the number.

    The current baud rate will now be displayed.  Press any key (except <ESC>
    or <CR>) to cycle through the available baud rates.  Press <CR> to select
    the one you want.  Use the same technique to select the parity, data
    bits, stop bits and echo.  You will now be prompted for a command file to
    link to the entry.  Enter the filename without an extension or path.  The
    same command file may be linked to any number of dialing directory
    entries.  To clear an existing command file, type a space and then <CR>.
    If you don't want to link a command file with this entry, then press <CR>
    without specifying a filename.

    ProComm 2.4                                             Dialing Directory



    After specifying the command file, you will be asked whether to save the
    entry to disk.  Enter "Y" to save your changes, "N" to abandon them.  You
    may also abandon a revision at any point by pressing <ESC>.  If you elect
    to save the entry, it will be written to disk, then the current page is
    redisplayed, reflecting the changes you have just made.  If you do not
    save the entry to disk, all your changes will be lost.


    Revising the Modem Command

    The modem dialing command, and its suffix, are settable in the Modem
    SetUp section of the SetUp command.


    Adding or Revising Long Distance Codes

    Long distance codes are used primarily for accessing alternate
    long-distance services.  Four such codes are provided, identified by the
    characters "-", "+", "@" and "#".  Enter "P" at the dialing directory
    "==>" prompt to display a window containing the current long distance
    code definitions.  Press any key to remove this window from the screen.

    To revise a long distance code, enter the "R" command.  Now enter the
    long distance code id character at the "Entry to revise" prompt.  The
    current string for that long distance code will be displayed, and you
    will be asked for the new value.  Control characters and carriage returns
    may be included in long distance codes by using translation conventions
    described earlier.  Press <CR> to complete the long distance code
    revision.  Pressing <CR> as the first character in the new string deletes
    that long distance code.  If you do not save the changes to disk, they
    will be in effect for the current session only.  Press <ESC> to abandon
    long distance code changes completely.

    Long distance codes are used to provide access to alternate long distance
    carriers, to dial through office PBX or switchboard equipment, or for
    similar uses.  Long distance codes may precede or follow the number in
    the dialing directory entry.  For example, say you wish to call some long
    distance number using your Sprint account.  Begin by setting up a long
    distance code.  Choose "R" to revise, then select the ld code to change
    (We'll use "#").  Set the "#" ld code to "123-4567,,,99999," where "123-
    4567" is your local Sprint telephone number, and "99999" is your Sprint
    account ID (or password).  To dial an entry, say number 14, using Sprint,
    enter "#14" at the "==>" prompt.  This is what happens: the modem will
    dial the local Sprint number, wait six seconds (the comma is a Hayes
    modem command convention for a two second delay) then enter your Sprint
    access code.  It then waits another 2 seconds (the final comma) then
    dials whatever happens to be specified in entry number 14.  Similar tasks
    can be performed using different ld codes.  And remember, each code may
    be placed either before (i.e. "#14"), after (i.e. "14#") or both before
    and after the entry to be dialed.


    Deleting Entries

    You can use the 'D' command to delete entries from your dialing
    directory.  A window will open and prompt you for a range of entries to
    delete.  Enter the starting and ending entry numbers for the range you


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      503
    ProComm 2.4                                             Dialing Directory


    wish to delete.  Leave the second field blank to delete a single entry.

    For example, to delete entries 15-25, enter "15" in the first space and
    "25" in the second.  After verification, those 11 entries will be
    deleted.  To delete just entry 37, enter "37" in the first space, and
    press <CR> in the second.  You'll be asked to verify that you actually
    want the entries deleted before any action is taken.


    Making a Call

    To dial an entry in your dialing directory, simply type the entry number
    (1-100) at the "==>" prompt.  To dial with a long distance code, place
    the code's identifier before and/or after the entry number.  For example,
    enter "14" to dial entry number 14.  Enter "#14" to dial entry number 14
    preceded by the long distance code identified by "#".  Enter "14+" to
    dial entry number 14 followed by the '+' long distance code.  ProComm
    will send the modem command, an optional long distance prefix, the
    number, an optional long distance code, and finally the modem command
    suffix to the modem.  All five parts of the dialing string are translated
    using the conventions described earlier under string translation (see
    Section 2).  The parameters for the dialed entry become the current
    settings and remain after the call is complete.

    If a command file is linked to the entry being dialed, the redial
    facility will be used to place the call.  When a connection is made,
    control is passed to the linked command file.  Command files can be very
    useful for setting up custom terminal configurations, performing
    automatic logons, loading specific keyboard macro files and many other
    functions.


    Manual Dialing

    To dial a number not in your directory, enter the manual dialing command
    ("M") at the "==>" prompt.  Then enter the telephone number you wish to
    dial.  ProComm will send the dialing command plus the string you entered,
    plus the modem command suffix.  A long distance code indicator may be
    used if it is the first and/or last character in the string (that is, you
    can enter "+212-555-1552", "212-555-1552#" or "+212-555-1552#").


    Printing the Directory

    ProComm lets you output your directory to a printer, disk file or any DOS
    device.  Type "L" at the "==>" prompt, then specify where to send the
    file.  Simply press <CR> to use the default of PRN.  You can even output
    the directory to the COM port you are using and send a listing of your
    directory to the remote computer.


    Automatic Redial with Circular Dialing Queue

    Some remote systems can be very hard to reach.  ProComm makes it easier
    to access hard-to-reach systems with its automatic redial feature.  Press
    Alt-R to invoke the redial procedure.  When the redial window opens,
    specify one or more dialing directory entries separated by blanks, commas
    or semicolons.  Entries may contain long distance codes.  ProComm will


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      504
    ProComm 2.4                                             Dialing Directory


    continuously redial the numbers in the list until you are connected.
    Pressing <CR> without specifying any entries will cause ProComm to dial
    the numbers that were in the list the last time it was used.

    If the redial time is exceeded, or ProComm senses one of the modem's no
    connect strings (specified in the SetUp screen), the program will
    automatically move to the next number in the list.  As each number is
    reached, it is removed from the circular queue.  To remove an entry that
    is being called from the list without first connecting, press the Del key
    while that number is being dialed.  You can also press the Space key to
    abort the current call and proceed to the next entry in the list.

    Set the length of time ProComm waits for some response by pressing the
    End key; specify the new time to wait (from 5 to 100 seconds) and press
    <CR>.  If you want this change to become permanent, respond "Y" to the
    "save to disk?" prompt.  Be certain, however, that the your modem's delay
    timeout is set at least as high as the wait time you specify here;
    otherwise, the modem will timeout and disconnect before the redial wait
    time is reached.  You can specify the redial timeout delay in the SetUp
    (Alt-S) screen as well as at the redial function.

    Between calls ProComm will delay for the amount of time specified by the
    modem pause delay parameter (see Section 3).  This delay is provided to
    allow the modem sufficient time to reset between calls.  To continue
    immediately with the next call, press the Space key.

    The alarm will sound when you connect during a redial.  If a command file
    is linked to the entry that has connected, program control will pass to
    the linked command file.  Command returns to you when that command file
    has finished its tasks.

    The ability to transfer information makes a communications program a very
    powerful tool.  ProComm gives you several choices for two-way information
    transfer via file transfer protocols.  With them you can upload (send)
    and download (receive) files from almost any system.


    Uploading Files

    Begin a file upload to another system by starting the transfer on the
    remote computer.  When the remote indicates that it is ready, press PgUp.
    You will be presented with a menu of protocol choices:

                              +----+ UPLOAD +----+
                              |                  |

                              |                  |
                              | Protocol:        |
                              +------------------+

    Enter the number of the protocol you wish to use.  A second window will
    prompt you for the name of the file to upload.  Enter the filename,
    including a path if you wish, then press <CR>.  Another window will open
    and report on the progress of the transfer.

    An ASCII upload is something of a special case.  No transfer progress
    window will be displayed, but the status line will indicate that an ASCII
    transfer is taking place.  ASCII uploads are under the control of several
    setup options.  The first set of options control pacing.  You can set
    ProComm to pause after it sends each line of text or after each character
    to avoid overflowing the receiver.  You may also set ProComm to wait to
    receive a specific character before sending the next line.  Another
    option allows you to specify if text is to be echoed locally.  In most
    cases you will want to let the remote do any echoing of transferred text.
    Still other options determine whether carriage returns or linefeeds
    should be stripped or translated from the outgoing file.


    Downloading Files

    Downloading files is just as easy.  After starting the download procedure


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      601
    ProComm 2.4                                                 File Transfer


    on the remote, press PgDn.  The protocol selection window is again
    displayed (but this time headed "DOWNLOAD").  Enter the number of the
    protocol you wish to use. If a Default Download Path has been specified
    in the General SetUp area, downloaded files will be placed in the
    specified directory.  Otherwise they will be placed in the currently
    logged drive and directory.

    If you select ASCII, XMODEM or YMODEM protocol, a window will open and
    you will be prompted for the filename.  In all other cases the filename
    is provided by the sender and you do not need to enter it locally.  If
    you enter the name of a file that already exists you will be asked if it
    should be overwritten.  If a filename provided by the sender already
    exists, the received file will be renamed by placing a dollar sign in the
    first position of the filename.  For example, if you select to download
    FILE1.EXE using the Telink protocol and that file already exists, the
    downloaded file will be named $ILE1.EXE.

    After you have specified the protocol and (possibly) the file name, a
    window will open which displays information regarding the transfer.  When
    the transfer is complete, or an abort is sensed, the alarm will sound and
    appropriate messages will be displayed.

    ASCII downloads are somewhat different from the others in two respects.
    First, no transfer status window is displayed.  A message on the status
    line indicates that an ASCII download is in effect.  Second, ASCII
    downloads need user intervention to complete.  Text will continue to be
    captured until you press <ESC> to terminate the transfer.

    There is, however, a large degree of control over various ASCII file
    transfer parameters.  These can be set from the SetUp screen (Alt-S).
    You can conform CR and LF translation in a number of ways, allowing
    transfer to or from almost any system.


                            File Transfer Protocols


    There are nine file transfer protocols available in ProComm:


    ASCII

    ASCII file transfer is the equivalent of typing information from one
    system to another.  The ASCII characters are sent in a one-way stream
    with no handshaking (other than XON/XOFF, if it is activated) or error
    checking performed.  This method is fine for some applications, but you
    are limited to text file transfer.

    One difference between an ASCII download and file logging is that all
    data (including terminal escape sequences) is captured, while during
    logging terminal control sequences (with the exception of formfeeds) are
    filtered out.

    ProComm provides a number of ASCII file transfer settings which allow you
    to transfer data to or from most any system.  These options are settable
    via the ASCII Transfer SetUp section of the SetUp facility.

    ProComm 2.4                                                 File Transfer


    XMODEM File Transfer

    XMODEM is a block-oriented error checking protocol released into the
    public domain by its creator, Ward Christensen.  It is very popular on
    electronic bulletin board systems.  XMODEM transfers only a single file
    at a time.  The protocol uses two-way communications and either a
    checksum or cyclic redundancy check for error checking.  XMODEM can
    handle text or executable files with over 99% accuracy.  ProComm supports
    and automatically adjusts for both the checksum and CRC variants.

    The XMODEM protocol is defined such that CRC checking is always attempted
    first.  If CRC is not acknowledged by the sender then the checksum method
    is used.  While ProComm correctly implements this system, however, some
    other systems do not.  As a result, a problem can arise if the remote
    system responds to the CRC attempt but uses checksums.

    Note that XMODEM requires transfers to be performed with 8 data bits, 1
    stop bit and no parity.  If you attempt to begin an XMODEM transfer while
    set to other parameters, ProComm will automatically switch to N/8/1,
    returning you to your original parameters when the transfer is complete.

    Some systems, such as CompuServe, have trouble meeting the standard
    XMODEM timing sequences.  You may set ProComm's XMODEM facility into a
    "relaxed" mode, which has less critical timing, using the SetUp (Alt-S)
    screen.  Most other systems, however, will work fine with XMODEM set to
    normal.


    MODEM7 File Transfers

    MODEM7 is a variant of the XMODEM protocol.  By sending the filename,
    batch transfers (multiple files) can be accomplished.  CRC and checksum
    are supported.


    YMODEM File Transfers

    YMODEM is another XMODEM variant.  Its main advantage is that it supports
    longer data blocks (1K) and thus speeds transfer times.  ProComm supports
    YMODEM for single file transfers and YMODEM Batch for multiple file
    transfers.  YMODEM Batch also provides some header information, such as
    filename and filesize.  YMODEM file transfers are always performed with
    CRC error checking.


    Telink File Transfers

    Telink is yet another XMODEM/MODEM7 variant which adds file size and
    creation date information.  It is found mainly on FIDO bulletin board
    systems, and provides for batch file transfers.


    Kermit File Transfer

    Kermit is a packet-oriented protocol developed at Columbia University and
    is available on many different computer systems.  By using a technique
    called 8th-bit quoting, Kermit is able to transfer binary files between 7
    and 8 bit systems.  In some implementations, such as ProComm, Kermit


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      603
    ProComm 2.4                                                 File Transfer


    supports multiple file transfers.

    ProComm's implementation of Kermit includes all of the latest Kermit
    enhancements, including data compression, file attributes, and sliding
    windows.

    The most significant of these features is sliding windows.  A "sliding
    window" protocol is a full duplex protocol that can transmit and receive
    data at the same time.  The XMODEM family of protocols are half duplex
    protocols.  They must wait between each block of data for a reply from
    the other side.  XMODEM wastes quite a bit of time this way.  Full duplex
    protocols can send a continuous stream of data while receiving replies at
    the same time, thus greatly increasing file transfer efficiency.  ProComm
    Kermit will automatically sense if the other Kermit supports sliding
    windows and will use them if it does.  Currently, Sliding Window Kermit
    is available on The Source, TCOMM BBS, and PC-HOST BBS.  Mainframe
    versions are under development and should be appearing soon.  ProComm
    Kermit is backward-compatible with earlier versions of Kermit.

    ProComm's default Kermit settings are fairly standard and should need to
    be changed only under special conditions.  Because of the sliding window
    enhancement, block size should be limited to a maximum of 90, rather than
    94 as in standard Kermit.

    In addition, a few Kermit server commands are supported.  Press Alt-K to
    access the Kermit server command menu.  Available commands include
    Finish, Logout, Send and Get.  Get (option 1) and Send (option 2) will
    both prompt you for the appropriate filename and then perform the
    indicated function, i.e. either GET (receive) or SEND (transmit) a file.
    Finish (option 3) will terminate the Kermit session and return you to the
    system level.  Logout (option 4) will terminate Kermit and log you off
    the remote.  These commands are effective only when the remote Kermit is
    operating in server mode.

    More information on Kermit is available from Columbia University.  Send
    $5 each for the Protocol or User manual to:

    CompuServe B File Transfers

    The CompuServe B protocol is available on the CompuServe Information
    Service.  It may be used with ProComm in two ways.  You may select it
    from the Upload or Download selection windows like any other protocol.
    You may also operate it in an automatic mode.  To do so, set the ENQ
    parameter in the Terminal SetUp section to CIS B.  This activates the
    automatic capabilities of ProComm to handle CompuServe B file transfers.
    All you need do at that point is instruct CIS to begin a transfer, and
    let the software do the rest.  Be sure not to set ENQ to CIS B unless you
    are connecting to CompuServe or strange results may occur.

                         7.  C O M M A N D   F I L E S



    Command files are text files you create that contain ProComm commands.
    You can use command files to perform automatic logons, perform unattended
    file transfers and many other tasks.  You can even link command files to
    the entries in your dialing directory so that the entire dialing and
    logon procedure is automated.

    You can create a command file using virtually any word processor which
    saves in straight ASCII format; if your word processor normally makes use
    of special or extended ASCII characters, then you should use its
    "non-document" mode.   A command file may have any valid filename;
    however, ProComm looks for files with an extension of .CMD when it lists
    available command files.

    Command files can be executed from within ProComm or as a command line
    option when you first invoke the program.  If you specify them on the
    command line, using the "/F" option, they will be executed immediately
    upon program startup.  Execute them from inside the program by pressing
    Alt-F5.  ProComm first searches the current directory for files with the
    .CMD extension.  If any are found, their names are displayed in the
    window.  If none are found, ProComm will look in the directory pointed to
    by the ProComm environment variable.  Again, the names of any files found
    are displayed in the window.  If no files are found in either directory,
    the  message "NO FILES" will be displayed.

    To execute a command file you may either type the filename or choose from
    the scrolling window display of available .CMD files.  If you type the
    filename, you may omit the .CMD extension.  To choose from the scrolling
    window, position the highlight on the name of the file you wish to
    execute and press <CR>.  PgUp and PgDn will scroll the window one page in
    either direction.  The arrow keys will scroll the window one entry in
    either direction.  Pressing the Home key will position the list at the
    first page of available command files; pressing End will position it at
    the last.  If you don't see the highlighted entry, use the Alt-Z command
    to change the color being used for highlighting so that it is different
    than that being used for regular foreground display.  The command file
    window uses the colors displayed in Alt-Z for the file transfer window.

    Once you begin to enter a command file name at the prompt you may still
    scroll the window, but you may not select a file for execution from the
    scrolling display.

    Abort a command file by pressing <ESC> during its execution.  The command
    file will abort when the current command has completed (which might take
    a few seconds).  In some cases, such as while dialing or performing a
    file transfer, two <ESC>'s are needed: one to abort the task in progress
    and a second to abort the command file.

    There is a special command file named PROFILE.CMD which ProComm looks for
    in the default directory first, then in the directory pointed to by the


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      701
    ProComm 2.4                                                 Command Files


    ProComm environment variable (see Section 1).  If PROFILE.CMD is found,
    it will be executed immediately upon program startup, before any other
    command file specified as a "/F" command line option.  You can use the
    profile to do such custom setup work as changing to a special directory,
    turning off the sound, changing line settings, or overriding the default
    modem initialization string.


    Command File Syntax

    Command file commands begin with special command words, listed below.
    Commands may be entered in either upper- or lower-case.  When processing
    commands ProComm looks only at the first 4 characters.  Thus all the
    following commands are treated the same:

          TRANSMIT = trans = Tran = TRANSM

    Each command must appear on a separate line.

         IF NOT CONNECTED                   ; this is correct
            MESSAGE "sorry!"                ;
         ENDIF                              ;

         IF NOT CONNECTED MESSAGE "sorry!"  ; this is incorrect
         ENDIF                              ;

    Many commands have one or more additional arguments; if the argument is
    listed in brackets ([]) it is optional, otherwise it is required.
    Arguments listed within quotation marks (" ") should include the
    quotation marks; thus the command RUN, if you wish to use it to run
    WordStar, would be typed

          RUN "WORDSTAR"

    Arguments may be separated by blanks or commas.  Thus both

          GETFILE XMODEM "FILE.EXT"

    and

          GETFILE,XMODEM,"FILE.EXT"

    are valid.

    To use the quotation character in a quoted string, precede it with the
    special escape character ` (the reverse tick mark, or accent grave, ASCII
    96).  Thus to print the message

          She said "Goodbye" and then went home.

    use the command

          MESSAGE "She said `"Goodbye`" and then went home."

    Labels are used as targets of GOTOs and GOSUBs.  Labels must end with a
    colon.  Below are some valid labels:

            LABEL1:


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      702
    ProComm 2.4                                                 Command Files


            This_is_a_long_label:
            JUMP1:
            split:
            GO_HERE:

    Labels must appear on a line by themselves.  (Comments are allowed on
    label lines; executable statements are not).  Labels may be of any
    length; however, only the first 8 characters are used by the interpreter.
    Thus LABEL_TAG1: and LABEL_TAG2 are the same as far as ProComm is
    concerned.

    Comments begin with a semi-colon (;).  Any text following a semi-colon is
    treated as comment text.  Below are valid comments:

            ; This is a comment.
            LABEL7:                   ;This is a comment on a label line
            TRANSMIT "Welcome back"   ;And this is a comment as well

    There are 10 string variables, named S0-S9, which may be set and used in
    place of quoted strings.  They have a maximum length of 80 characters
    each.  They may be set by the ASSIGN, GET and RGET commands.  String
    variables may be used in place of a quoted string in any of the commands
    marked below with the @ character.  For example, the commands

          ASSIGN S5 "Hello, Mike Todd here"
          TRANSMIT S5

    and

          TRANSMIT "Hello, Mike Todd here"

    are functionally the same.  One of the most useful applications of string
    variables is in obtaining and using user responses.  Consider the
    commands below:

          MESSAGE "Enter the name of the file to upload:"
          GET S4
          SENDFILE XMODEM S4

    String variables are also a very handy method for passing values between
    command files.  When you chain from command file to command file, using
    the EXECUTE command, string variable contents are not reset.  Thus you
    may set a variable in one command file, and act on the variable in
    another.

    ProComm allows the nesting of commands such as IF, SWITCH and GOSUB.
    Nesting, however, is limited to 10 levels.

    Characters that are received from a remote system are stored in the
    receive buffer.  During command file execution, the receive buffer is
    emptied before each command is executed, with the exceptions noted below.
    What this means is that before each command is performed, all the
    characters that have come in are displayed on the screen and are
    therefore not available to be processed by later commands.  The
    exceptions are the GET, RGET and WAITFOR commands, as well as labels and
    comments.  In these cases the buffer is not emptied, allowing the command
    to process the accumulated characters.  The point here is that if you
    have a command sequence that looks like

          TRANSMIT "password!"
          PAUSE 5
          SET DUPLEX HALF
          WAITFOR "target"

    the text you are looking for may come in and be processed before the
    WAITFOR command has a chance to see it.  A better solution would be to
    change duplex at some other point, and let the WAITFOR command do the
    extra pausing:

          SET DUPLEX HALF
          TRANSMIT "password!"
          WAITFOR "target" 35           ; 30 seconds is the default pause


    Use the commands described below to perform your specific task.  Be sure
    to test your command files thoroughly before using them for unattended
    communications.

    The following notations apply to the commands listed below:  Commands
    marked with an asterisk (*) may be tested with the IF command.  Commands
    marked with an at-sign (@) indicate where string variables may be used in
    place of quoted strings.  Sx indicates that you should use one of the
    string variables.  Ellipses (...) mean that you may place a number of
    command lines in that spot.


                               Top Level Commands


    ALARM [seconds]

    The ALARM command will sound an alarm to alert you to some event.  Use
    the [seconds] option to determine the amount of time the alarm will
    sound.  If the [seconds] option is not specified ProComm will use the
    Alarm Time specified in the General SetUp screen.  This command is also
    under control of the Alarm Sound setting.  Both Alarm Sound and Alarm
    Time may be regulated using the SET command described below.

    Example:   ALARM 5             ; sounds the alarm for 5 seconds


    ASSIGN Sx "string"        @

    This command assigns the contents of "string" to a user variable.  Use
    ASSIGN to set a user variable from within your command file.

    Examples:  ASSIGN S5 "12345"   ; set S5 to contain the string '12345'
               ASSIGN S6 S5        ; sets S6 to be the same as S5


    BREAK [time]

    The BREAK command is used to send a break to the remote system.  The
    optional [time] argument determines the length of the break in
    milliseconds.  If [time] is not specified, ProComm will use the default
    as indicated by the Break Length option in the Terminal SetUp screen.


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      704
    ProComm 2.4                                                 Command Files



    Examples:  BREAK               ; send a break using the default timing

               BREAK 500           ; send a 500 millisecond break


    CHDIR "drive and/or directory"        @

    The CHDIR command will change the logged directory and/or drive.

    Examples:  CHDIR "A:"          ; change the logged drive to A:

               CHDIR "C:\COMM"     ; change to \COMM dir on drive C:

               CHDIR "\COMM"       ; change logged dir to \COMM


    CLEAR [bg fg]

    The CLEAR command is used to clear the top 24 lines of your screen.  The
    optional parameter [bg fg] (you must use both codes) allows you to change
    your background (bg) and foreground (fg) colors.  If the [bg fg] option
    is not used, the screen will be cleared to the current colors.  If the
    [bg fg] option is used, ProComm will clear the screen to the new colors
    as well as reset the current colors to those specified.  The codes to use
    for colors are as follows:

          0 Black                   8 Dk Grey        (8-15 are the bright
          1 Blue                    9 Lt Blue         colors)
          2 Green                  10 Lt Green
          3 Cyan                   11 Lt Cyan
          4 Red                    12 Lt Red
          5 Magenta                13 Lt Magenta
          6 Brown                  14 Yellow
          7 Lt Grey                15 White

    Only the codes 0-7 are valid for background colors; any of the sixteen
    colors may be used for the foreground.

    Examples:  CLEAR 0 10          ; clear screen to lt green on black

               CLEAR               ; clear screen to current colors


    DIAL "entry"        @

    The DIAL command is used to call an entry in your dialing directory.
    Specify the number of the entry, optionally preceded and/or followed by a
    long distance code identifier as the argument.

    Examples:  DIAL "5"            ; call entry number 5

               DIAL "#5"           ; call entry 5 using ld code '#'

    If a second command file is linked via the dialing directory to the entry
    being dialed, the linked command file will not be executed.  Place all
    statements to be executed in the command file which initiates the call.



    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      705
    ProComm 2.4                                                 Command Files


    Use the IF LINKED command to avoid secondary dialing in command files
    linked to dialing directory entries.  For example, including the commands

          IF NOT LINKED            ; do not execute the dial command if
               DIAL "5"            ; this file is executing via linkage
          ENDIF                    ; to a dialing directory entry

    in a command file linked to entry number 5 allows you to use that command
    file both as a stand alone file and linked to the dialing directory
    entry.

    This command uses the auto redial facility to place its calls; it will
    keep re-dialing until a connection is made.  To make a call without using
    auto redial, use the TRANSMIT command.

    Examples:  TRANSMIT "ATDT1 314 449-9401!"     ; place the call
               PAUSE 10                           ; wait 10 seconds
               IF CONNECTED
                    ...                           ; do these commands if
               ENDIF                              ; connected

    Remember, if you sort your dialing directory you will need to change your
    command files so the entry numbers match.


    DOS "command" [WAIT]        @ *

    The DOS command allows you to execute DOS commands or other programs from
    within a ProComm .CMD file.  Enter the "command" as it would appear on
    the DOS command line.  For example, to go out to DOS and type a file
    named FILE.EXT to your printer use the command:

          DOS "type FILE.EXT > prn"

    If the optional argument WAIT is included, ProComm will wait for a
    keystroke after executing the command, before returning to ProComm.

    To execute this command properly you must make sure of two things.
    First, you must have enough memory to run the "command".  Secondly,
    COMMAND.COM must be where ProComm can find it.  (Either in the boot
    location or wherever COMSPEC is pointing).  While this command returns an
    error status checkable with the IF command, the error check is very
    limited.  The DOS command will indicate FAILURE only if COMMAND.COM was
    not found.  IF COMMAND.COM was found, even if the command to be executed
    was invalid, SUCCESS will be returned.

    Examples:  DOS "del FILE.EXT"       ; delete a file

               DOS "sortdisk"           ; run a program called sortdisk
               IF FAILURE
                    MESSAGE "COMMAND.COM not found"
               ENDIF

    CAUTION: If you execute a program or command requiring user input be sure
    you are around to provide it, since the program will wait until you do.


    EMULATE terminal -or- EMULATE "terminal"

    ProComm 2.4                                                 Command Files



    The EMULATE command changes the active emulation to that specified.
    Valid terminal types are: VT100, VT52, IBM3101, TV920, TV950, ADM5,
    HEATH19, ANSI, ADDSVP and WYSE100.

    Examples:  EMULATE VT100       ; change emulation to VT100

               EMULATE "IBM3101"   ; emulate the 3101


    EXECUTE "cmd file"        @

    The EXECUTE command allows you to begin execution of a different command
    file.  The currently executing command file will be ended and will not be
    returned to.   The EXECUTE commands allows a one-way chaining of command
    file execution.  The file extension of .CMD need not be specified.

    Remember, string variables are not reset when chaining command files so
    you may use them to pass values.  String variables are reset to null,
    however, when you begin the first command in the chain.

    Examples:  EXECUTE "CALL_KEN.CMD"        ; execute CALL_KEN.CMD

               GET S0                        ; get the option
               SWITCH S0                     ; switch based on option
                    CASE "A"
                         ASSIGN S1 "CHOICEA.CMD"
                    ENDCASE
                    CASE "B"
                         ASSIGN S1 "CHOICEB.CMD"
                    ENDCASE
                    DEFAULT
                         ASSIGN S1 "DEFAULT.CMD"
                    ENDCASE
               ENDSWITCH
               EXECUTE S1


    EXIT

    The EXIT command terminates the executing command file and returns you to
    Terminal Mode.

    Examples:  TRANSMIT "Goodbye"       ; log off remote
               HANGUP                   ; hangup phone
               EXIT                     ; return to Terminal Mode


    FIND Sx "target"        @ *

    The FIND command looks for an occurrence of the "target" string in the
    string variable Sx.  Test for an occurrence of "target" within Sx using
    the IF FOUND command.  The FIND command is not case sensitive.

    Examples:  MESSAGE "Enter the password:"      ; prompt
               MGET S0                            ; get with mask
               FIND S0 "password"                 ; look for password
               IF NOT FOUND                       ; found ?

                    GOTO SECURITY_BREACH
               ELSE

               ENDIF


    GET Sx [length]

    The GET command is used to obtain and store user input.  The Sx argument
    determines which string variable is used to hold the data.  The optional
    [length] variable determines the maximum number of characters that will
    be accepted.  If the [length] argument is not specified, the maximum size
    of 80 characters is used.

    When responding to a GET command, the user must enter a <CR> to signal
    that his input is complete.  The <CR> is not included in the string
    variable.  If the [length] argument is used, the user will be allowed to
    enter up to [length] number of characters, but still must use a <CR> to
    complete his entry.  ProComm will beep if the user attempts to enter more
    than [length] characters.

    The MGET command is the same as the GET command except that the text the
    user enters is not displayed; rather each character typed will display as
    an asterisk (*).  This is handy for security-related items such as
    passwords.

    Examples:  MESSAGE "Enter your choice: (A,B or C)"
               GET S3 1
               SWITCH S3
                    ...

    The GETFILE command performs a file download (receive).  A number of
    protocols are currently supported; see the section on file transfers for
    more information on each protocol.

    To perform a download you must first initiate the transfer on the remote.
    When that system indicates that it is ready, begin your transfer.

    Note that 4 protocols require you to specify the filename to receive; for
    the other protocols, the filename is provided by the sending system.  All
    transfers may be checked for successful completion using the IF
    SUCCESS/FAILURE command.

    Examples:  WAITFOR "Begin your transfer now"  ; wait till it's ready
               GETFILE XMODEM "FILE.EXT"          ; receive FILE.EXT

               WAITFOR "Kermit-32>"               ; wait for prompt
               MESSAGE "Enter file to transfer"   ; transfer a file with
    GET S1                              ; Kermit
               TRANSMIT "SEND "                   ; send transfer command
               TRANSMIT S1                        ; the file name
               TRANSMIT "^M"                      ; and a CR
               GETFILE KERMIT                     ; now get it


    GOSUB label

    The GOSUB command provides for an unconditional branch with return.  Upon
    encountering a GOSUB command, the interpreter searches the command file
    for the label specified.  If the label is found, execution will continue
    with the command immediately following the label.  If the label is not
    found, the command file will terminate with an "Unexpected end of file"
    error.

    After successfully branching to the specified label, execution will
    continue until a RETURN command is found, at which point ProComm will
    jump back to the point at which the GOSUB was called.  Execution resumes
    at the command immediately following the GOSUB.  Each GOSUB must have its
    associated RETURN.

    GOSUBs may be nested to a depth of 10 levels.  If the end of the command
    file is encountered within a GOSUB, an "Unexpected end of file" error
    will occur.  If you attempt to nest more than 10 GOSUB calls, a "Stack
    overflow" error will result.  Likewise, if you attempt to RETURN without
    having a corresponding GOSUB, a "Stack underflow" error will occur.

    Examples:  SWITCH S0           ; switch based on the contents of S0
                    CASE "ABC"
                         GOSUB LABEL1
                    ENDCASE
                    CASE "ZXY"
                         GOSUB LABEL2
                    ENDCASE
                    DEFAULT
                         GOSUB ERROR1
                    ENDCASE
               ENDSWITCH
                    ...

                                   ; Subroutine area

               RETURN

               LABEL2:

               ERROR1:
                    ...
               RETURN


    GOTO label

    The GOTO command performs an unconditional branch to the indicated label.
    Upon encountering a GOTO command, the interpreter searches the command
    file for the label specified.  If the label is found, execution will
    continue with the command immediately following the label.  If the label
    is not found, the command file will terminate with an "Unexpected end of
    file" error.  Remember, only the first 8 characters of a label are
    actually used.  If two identical labels exists, ProComm will branch to
    the one closest to the beginning of the file.

    GOTOs may not be used to jump into the middle of IF or SWITCH statements,
    although they may be used to branch out of those constructs.  They should
    also not be used to branch into or out of subroutines (code segments
    designed to be used with the GOSUB command), although they may be used
    within the boundaries of individual subroutines.  Use of a GOTO in these
    situations will result in unexpected and usually erroneous execution.

    Examples:  IF NOT WAITFOR
                    GOTO ERROR_EXIT          ; this is OK
               ENDIF
                  ...
               ERROR_EXIT:
                    MESSAGE "Abnormal termination"
                    HANGUP
                    QUIT

               GOTO LABEL1                   ; this is not OK
               SWITCH S0
                    CASE "xyz"
                    LABEL1:
                    etc.


    HANGUP        *

    The HANGUP command attempts to disconnect the phone in the manner
    described for the Alt-H command in Section 3.  Use the IF CONNECTED
    command to determine if you successfully disconnected.

    Example:   HANGUP              ; disconnect the phone


    HOST

    The HOST command is used to put ProComm into Host Mode.



    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      710
    ProComm 2.4                                                 Command Files


    Example:   HOST           ; enter host mode


    IF condition

    The IF command is used to make decisions.  The syntax of the IF statement
    is
          IF condition
               [part 1]
          ELSE
               [part 2]
          ENDIF

    where the ELSE part is optional.  The condition is evaluated; if it is
    true, [part 1] is executed.  If it is false, and there is an ELSE,
    [part 2] is executed.  There must be an ENDIF for every IF.  IF commands
    may be nested up to 10 levels deep.

    Valid conditions for the IF command are

          SUCCESS        CONNECTED      FOUND
          FAILURE        LINKED         WAITFOR

    The SUCCESS condition is evaluated as true if the last checkable command
    was successfully executed.  A "checkable" command is a command file
    command that sets one of the condition flags.  Checkable commands are
    indicated in this chapter by having an asterisk (*) after the command
    name.  For example:

          RUN "someprog"
          IF SUCCESS
               ...            ; this segment will execute if "someprog" ran.
          ENDIF

    The FAILURE condition is considered true if the last checkable command
    was not successfully completed.  For example, if you had an RGET command
    that timed out, FAILURE would be considered true:

          RGET S9 80 5
          IF FAILURE
               ...            ; this segment will execute if RGET times out.
          ENDIF

    The CONNECTED condition is true if CD (Carrier Detect) is found to be
    high.  CD is high when you are connected to a remote system, or if your
    modem is forcing the CD lead high.  WARNING: be sure that your modem does
    not force CD high (usually a dip switch setting) or the CONNECTED
    condition will always be true.

          IF CONNECTED
               ...            ; perform this segment if you are connected
          ENDIF

    The LINKED condition is considered true if the command file that is
    executing was started because it was linked to an entry in the dialing
    directory.  In other words, if you have a command file called VAX.CMD
    which is linked to dialing directory entry number 5, and you call entry
    number 5 and are connected, and VAX.CMD begins execution, an IF command


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      711
    ProComm 2.4                                                 Command Files


    that looks like

          IF LINKED
               ...
          ENDIF

    will be considered true.  The primary use for the LINKED condition is so
    you can write one command file and use it both stand alone and linked to
    dialing directory entries.

          IF NOT LINKED
               DIAL 5
          ENDIF

    In this code segment, the DIAL command will be executed only if the
    command file was not executed because of a dialing directory link.  (More
    on the NOT option below).

    The FOUND condition is used to test the result of the last FIND command
    executed.  It is considered true if the "target" was found in the
    specified string variable.  For example, in the sequence

          ASSIGN S9 "ABCDEFG"
          FIND S9 "CDE"
          IF FOUND
               ...
          ENDIF

    the commands denoted by ellipses (...) would be executed, as the FOUND
    condition would be true.

    The WAITFOR condition is used to check the result of the last WAITFOR
    command.  If the "target" specified in the WAITFOR command was received,
    the WAITFOR condition would be true.  If the WAITFOR command timed out
    before receiving the "target", the condition would be false.

          WAITFOR "ABCDEFG" 15     ; wait 15 seconds for 'ABCDEFG'
          IF WAITFOR
               ...                 ; execute if 'ABCDEFG' was received
          ELSE
               ...                 ; execute if timed out
          ENDIF

    The NOT operative may be employed with any of the conditionals.  The
    effect of the NOT is to reverse the value of the condition.  For example,
    if CONNECTED is false, then NOT CONNECTED would be true.  The conditions
    NOT SUCCESS and FAILED are exactly the same.  The code segments

          IF FOUND                 IF NOT FOUND
               [part 1]                 [part 2]
          ELSE                     ELSE
               [part 2]                 [part 1]
          ENDIF                    ENDIF

    will result in identical execution.

    Examples:  IF NOT CONNECTED
                    ...                 ; do this if no connection

               WAITFOR "Something"
               IF WAITFOR
                    ...                 ; do this if it was found
               ELSE
                    ...                 ; else do this
               ENDIF

               SEND_IT:
               SENDFILE KERMIT "FILE.EXT"
               IF NOT SUCCESS
                    MESSAGE "Error in file transfer.  Retrying..."
                    GOTO SEND_IT
               ENDIF

               ; How to redial without using Alt-R

               DOIT:

                    MESSAGE "No connect.  Redialing..."
                    GOTO DOIT
               ENDIF


    ISFILE "filename"        @ *

    The ISFILE command is used to determine if a specific file exists in the
    current directory.  Use the IF SUCCESS/FAILURE command to test the
    results of the ISFILE command.

    Examples:  ISFILE "procomm.doc"
               IF SUCCESS
                    MESSAGE "Doc file exists"
               ELSE
                    MESSAGE "Doc file not found"
               ENDIF

               MESSAGE "Enter filename"
               GET S0
               ISFILE S0
               IF NOT SUCCESS
                    MESSAGE "File does not exist"
               ENDIF


    KERMSERVE
              SENDFILE "filename"        @ *
              GETFILE "filename"         @ *
              FINISH
              LOGOUT

    The KERMSERVE command may be used to issue a Kermit server command.  The
    available commands are listed above.

    Examples:  MESSAGE "File to send?"  ; prompt for filename


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      713

               KERMSERVE SENDFILE S0    ; send file
               KERMSERVE FINISH         ; issue the FINISH server command


    KFLUSH

    The KFLUSH command is used to clear any accumulated keystrokes from the
    keyboard buffer.  Any keystrokes that have been entered, but not
    processed, will be lost.

    Examples:  KFLUSH                   ; clear keyboard buffer


    LOCATE row col

    The LOCATE command positions the cursor to the location specified by row
    and col (column).  Rows are numbered 0-24, columns 0-79, with 0,0 (row 0,
    col 0) being the upper left corner of the screen.

    Examples:  CLEAR                    ; clear the screen
               LOCATE 10 20             ; position cursor
               MESSAGE "ENTER CHOICE:"
               LOCATE 10 44             ; position at end of line
               GET S8


    LOG
        OPEN ["filename"]        @ *
        CLOSE
        SUSPEND
        RESUME

    The LOG command controls file logging during command file execution.  Use
    the OPEN command to start logging data to disk.  If "filename" is not
    present, the Default Log File as specified in the General SetUp section
    will be used.  Use the CLOSE command to turn off file logging.  The
    SUSPEND command will stop text from being logged temporarily without
    closing the log file.  Use the RESUME command to continue logging after a
    SUSPEND command.

    Examples:  LOG OPEN            ; use default log name
                 ...
               LOG SUSPEND         ; put log on hold
                 ...
               LOG RESUME          ; resume logging
                 ...
               LOG CLOSE           ; close log


    MACRO number -or- MACRO "number"        @

    The MACRO command will send the string currently assigned to any of the
    macro keys (Alt-0 through Alt-9).  Use the MLOAD command to load
    individual keyboard macro definition files.

    Examples:  MACRO 5             ; send macro assigned to Alt-5

               ASSIGN S8 "2"
               MACRO S8            ; send macro assigned to Alt-2


    MESSAGE "string"        @

    The MESSAGE command displays a string on the local console.  The text is
    not sent to the remote.  The message is displayed at the current cursor
    position, in the current colors.  MESSAGE will always do a CR/LF after
    each string.  The "string" may contain control characters such as CR and
    LF by using the translation conventions described in Section 2.  Use the
    MESSAGE command for prompts, informational messages, building menus, etc.

    Examples:  MESSAGE "+---------------------+"
               MESSAGE "| Enter your choice:  |"
               MESSAGE "+---------------------+"
               LOCATE 2,20
               GET S0 1
               SWITCH S0
                 etc.

               ASSIGN S9 "This is the first line^M^JThis is the second"
               MESSAGE S9


    MLOAD "filename"        @

    The MLOAD command is used to load a keyboard macro file.

    Example:   MLOAD "SYSTEM1.KEY"      ; load a new macro file


    PAUSE seconds -or- PAUSE "seconds"

    The PAUSE command halts command file execution for the specified number
    of seconds.  Characters received during a pause are not displayed until
    after the pause has completed.

    Examples:  TRANSMIT "Kermit send file.ext"    ; start the transfer
               PAUSE 3                            ; let the remote start
               KERMIT RECEIVE                     ; receive the file


    PRINTER
            ON
            OFF

    The PRINTER command is use to control print logging.  Use the ON argument
    to begin logging the session to the printer; use OFF to end logging.
    ProComm writes the printer log to the DOS device PRN.  You can use the
    MODE command in DOS to redirect printer output.

    Examples:  PRINTER ON          ; begin print logging
                 ...
               PRINTER OFF         ; end print logging


    QUIT

    ProComm 2.4                                                 Command Files



    The QUIT command terminates the executing command file and exits ProComm
    as well.  Use it only to shut down the entire program.

    Examples:  TRANSMIT "Logoff"        ; log off remote
               HANGUP                   ; hangup the phone
               QUIT                     ; close down ProComm


    RFLUSH

    The RFLUSH command is used to clear the input buffer.  Any characters
    that have been received, but not yet displayed, will be lost when this
    command is issued.  It is generally used to clear the input buffer in
    preparation for some task.

    Example:   RFLUSH              ; clear the input buffer


    RGET Sx [length] [delay]        *

    The RGET command provides services similar to those of the GET command;
    however, input is taken from the remote computer rather than from the
    keyboard.  The RGET command will complete when a <CR> is received or
    [length] characters have been received.  Unlike with the GET command, a
    <CR> is not required if [length] characters have been received.  Use the
    [delay] argument to specify the maximum number of seconds to wait for the
    string to be received before timing out.  If [delay] seconds have elapsed
    without receiving a <CR> or [length] characters, the RGET command will
    timeout and execution will continue.  You can determine if the command
    timed out using the IF SUCCESS/FAILED command.  You must specify [length]
    if you wish to specify [delay].  If length is not specified, the maximum
    of 80 characters is used; if [delay] is not specified, the default of 30
    seconds is used.

    Examples:  TRANSMIT "ATS0=1^M"      ; go into auto answer
               WAIT_IT_OUT:
               IF NOT CONNECTED         ; wait for a connection
                    GOTO WAIT_IT_OUT
               ENDIF
               TRANSMIT "ENTER PASSWORD:"
               RGET S9 8 45             ; wait 45 seconds max
               IF FAILED                ; timed out
                    TRANSMIT "Times up.  Goodbye"
                    HANGUP
                    GOTO WAIT_IT_OUT
               ENDIF

               IF NOT FOUND
                    TRANSMIT "Sorry , but you're not authorized."
                    HANGUP

    execute internal DOS commands.  See the explanation of the DOS command
    for conditions necessary for the correct execution of this command.  A
    major difference between the DOS and the RUN commands is the error codes
    returned.  RUN will report any non-zero return code from the "program" as
    FAILURE; only "programs" exiting with a return code of zero will indicate
    SUCCESS.

    If the optional argument WAIT is included, ProComm will wait for a
    keystroke after executing the program, before returning to ProComm.

    Examples:  RUN "filesort"      ; execute a program called filesort

               ASSIGN S0 "filesort"
               RUN S0
               IF FAILURE
                    MESSAGE "filesort returned error"

    The SENDFILE command performs a file upload (send).  Many different
    protocols are currently supported; see the section on file transfers for
    more information on each protocol.

    To perform an upload you must first initiate the transfer on the remote.
    When that system indicates that it is ready, begin your transfer.

    All 9 protocols require that you specify the filename to send. All
    transfers may be checked for successful completion using the IF
    SUCCESS/FAILURE command.

    Examples:  WAITFOR "Begin your transfer now"  ; wait till it's ready
               SENDFILE XMODEM "FILE.EXT"         ; send FILE.EXT

               WAITFOR "Kermit-32>"               ; wait for prompt

    The SET command is used to control various system parameters and options.
    It is fully described in the next section.


    SNAPSHOT

    The SNAPSHOT command performs a screen dump as described in Section 3.

    Example:   SNAPSHOT       ; dump the screen contents to the .IMG file


    SWITCH Sx

    The SWITCH command provides special multi-way decision making.  A SWITCH
    compares the value of a string variable against a number of constants and
    branches accordingly.  The syntax of a SWITCH command is:

          SWITCH S2                          ; switch based on S2
               CASE "target1"                ; if S2 = 'target1'
                    ...                      ; do these commands
               ENDCASE                       ; until here
               CASE "target2"                ; any number of cases
                    ...
               ENDCASE                       ; needed for each case
               DEFAULT                       ; if no previous case matches
                    ...                      ; do these commands
               ENDCASE
          ENDSWITCH                          ; ends the SWITCH

    The string variable Sx contains some value, usually put there by a GET or
    RGET command.  When a SWITCH command is found, ProComm begins looking for
    a CASE statement that contains a "target" which matches the string
    variable specified in the SWITCH.  The match must be complete, although
    it is not case sensitive.  Thus the values 'ABC', 'abc' or 'AbC' would
    all match a CASE 'abc' command, but the values 'ABCDE', 'XYZabc' or
    'a b c' would not.

    After finding a CASE that matches, ProComm will continue command file
    execution starting with the command immediately following the matching
    CASE.  Execution continues until an ENDCASE command is found.  At that
    point ProComm skips to the command immediately following the matching
    ENDSWITCH command and resumes execution.  Note that each CASE statement
    must have a matching ENDCASE, and each SWITCH a matching ENDSWITCH.

    There is a special case known as the DEFAULT case.  The commands within
    the DEFAULT case will be executed if no previous CASE matched the string
    variable.  The DEFAULT case is optional and need not be specified.  If
    there is no DEFAULT case, and no other match is found, command file
    execution will continue with the statement following the ENDSWITCH
    command.

    Another special case the _NULL case.  The _NULL case will be executed if
    the string variable being switched on is null, i.e., has no value.  For
    example, if a user enters a CR only in reply to a GET or RGET command,
    the string variable being gotten will be null.  The _NULL case would then
    be triggered.  The correct syntax for the _NULL case is:

          CASE "_NULL"

    Examples:  (display some menu of options)
               GET_CHOICE:
               MESSAGE "Enter your choice"
               GET S5
               SWITCH S5                     ; switch based on S5
                    CASE "A"                 ; if S5 = 'a' or 'A'
                         GOSUB CHOICEA       ; do this
                    ENDCASE
                    CASE "B"                 ; if S5 = 'b' or 'B'
                         GOSUB CHOICEB       ; do this
                    ENDCASE
                    CASE "_NULL"             ; do this if user pressed
                         GOSUB NULL_CASE     ; only CR
                    ENDCASE
                    DEFAULT                  ; S5 not = to 'A' or 'B' or NULL
                         MESSAGE "Invalid selection"
                         PAUSE 3
                         GOTO GET_CHOICE
                    ENDCASE
               ENDSWITCH

               MESSAGE "Continue? (Yes/No)"  ; prompt
               GET S7                        ; get response
               SWITCH S7                     ; switch based on response
                    CASE "NO"                ; they said "no"
                         QUIT                ; so leave
                    ENDCASE
               ENDSWITCH

    One use of a SWITCH command is to get a choice from the user, and then to
    perform various tasks depending upon the option selected.  In the first
    example, the command file would begin by presenting some list of options.
    You could easily build a menu using the MESSAGE and LOCATE commands.  The
    command file could then prompt the user for his selection, and GET the
    selection into a string variable, in this case S5.  The command file will
    branch based on the user's selection.  If the user entered the letter
    'A', the SWITCH will execute the first case and call the subroutine
    entitled CHOICEA.  After returning from that subroutine, execution will
    continue with the first statement following the ENDSWITCH command.  If
    the user had entered 'B' as his choice, the CHOICEB subroutine would have
    been executed.

    If neither 'A' nor 'B' had been entered by the user the DEFAULT case
    would execute.  In that event the "Invalid selection" message would be
    displayed, the program would pause for 3 seconds, and then branch back up
    to the GET_CHOICE label and the process would be repeated.

    In the second example, if the user had entered 'No' the first case would
    execute and the command file would QUIT.  In all other cases, no part of
    the SWITCH would execute, and the command file would continue.



    TRACE ON/OFF

    The TRACE command allows you to "trace" the execution of a command file.
    If you set TRACE ON, every command will be printed to the screen, in


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      719
    ProComm 2.4                                                 Command Files


    contrasting colors, as it is executed.  TRACE is very handy for debugging
    errant command files.

    Examples:  TRACE ON                 ; set trace on


    TRANSMIT "string"        @

    The TRANSMIT command sends a character string to the remote.  The
    "string" may contain control characters using the standard translation
    conventions.

    Examples:  MESSAGE "Enter your ID"       ; send the prompt
               GET S6                        ; get the ID
               TRANSMIT S6                   ; send the ID
               TRANSMIT "!"                  ; plus a CR

               WAITFOR "First name:"         ; Wait for a prompt
               TRANSMIT "TOM!"               ; send the name plus a CR


    WAITFOR "target" [delay]        @ *

    The WAITFOR command allows you to wait for a particular string to be
    received from the remote before command file execution continues.  The
    [delay] option tells ProComm how many seconds to wait for the "target"
    before timing out and continuing execution.  If no [delay] is specified,
    ProComm will wait 30 seconds.

    Use the IF WAITFOR condition to test the results of a WAITFOR command.

    Examples:  WAITFOR "first name:" 45    ; wait for the string "first name"
                                           ; for 45 seconds
               IF WAITFOR                  ; if it was found w/o timing out
                    TRANSMIT "TOM!"        ; send your name
               ELSE                        ; else
                    GOTO ERROR             ; go to error processing
               ENDIF

    WAITFOR targets are not case sensitive, thus either "FIRST NAME" or
    "First Name" would successfully complete the command sequence above.  You
    may also include control character in the target using the translation
    conventions described earlier.

    Example:   WAITFOR "^M^JBUSY"       ; wait for CR LF then BUSY


    WHEN "target" "response"        @

    The WHEN command is used to transmit a certain "response" text every time
    a certain "target" text is received.  Once a WHEN command is initiated,
    it will be in effect until a CWHEN (Clear WHEN) command is found or the
    command file ends.  For example, suppose you are calling an online
    service that displays a "-more-" prompt at the end of each page of
    display, and waits for you to enter a carriage return before it
    continues.  By specifying the command

          WHEN "-more-" "^M"


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      720
    ProComm 2.4                                                 Command Files



    at the beginning of the command file, you are instructing ProComm to
    transmit a CR (^M) every time it receives the string "-more-", thus
    relieving you of the task of matching every occurrence of "-more-" with a


          WAITFOR "-more-"
          TRANSMIT "^M"

    command sequence.

    Examples:  WHEN "continue? (Y/N)" "Y^M"       ; send a 'Y<CR>' for
                    ...                           ; every "continue" received
               CWHEN                              ; turn off WHEN processing


                                  Set Commands


    All SET commands have the same format:

          SET parameter value

    The SET commands are used to change the value of the parameters in the
    SetUp facility (Alt-S) and the Line Settings window (Alt-P).  Available
    values are separated by slashes (/).  Because those parameters are
    described in detail in other sections, an in-depth discussion is not
    presented here.  The appropriate SetUp section is indicated in
    parenthesis for each command.

    ProComm 2.4                                                     Host Mode







                              8.  H O S T  M O D E



    ProComm includes a limited remote access facility known as Host Mode.
    Host Mode allows remote access to your computer for tasks such as file
    transfer and DOS shell access.  In addition, it provides password
    security, a logon message, and can maintain a history of logons.  Host
    Mode is intended to allow a user access to his home machine from work (or
    vice versa); it is not intended as a multi-user message base or bulletin
    board system.


                                 Host Mode Setup


    Host mode requires some setup before it can be used.  Setup is composed
    of three basic parts: modem, operating system, and ProComm.  Each must be
    correctly configured before attempting to use Host Mode.


    Modem Setup

    Host Mode depends quite a bit on the correct installation of your modem.
    Because there are many different modems available, not all of which we
    are familiar with, you may have to do a bit of reading in your modem
    manual.

    First, Carrier Detect (CD) on your modem must be set to follow the true
    state of carrier.  Carrier detect must not be forced true, or high, by
    dip switch settings.  Carrier detect also should not be set to follow
    DTR.  It should be set to follow the "real state", or the "RS-232
    convention" or however your manual says it.  Carrier detect is usually
    controlled by a dip switch setting on your modem, although on some new
    modems, like the Hayes 2400, you use a software command like &C1 and &D2.
    On a Hayes 1200 external modem you should have dip switch 6 in the UP
    position.

    Next, data terminal ready (DTR) should also follow the real state.  It
    should not be forced high.  On a Hayes modem, this means switch 1 is UP.

    Your cable might also have an impact on correct operation.  Your modem
    manual should have an explanation of proper cable configurations.


    Operating System Setup

    Operating system setup revolves around the CONFIG.SYS file.  CONFIG.SYS
    is a configuration file which contains commands used to configure your
    system.  Each time you start DOS, the operating systems searches the root
    directory of the drive you booted from for a file called CONFIG.SYS.  If
    it is found, DOS reads the file and interprets the commands it contains.



    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      801
    ProComm 2.4                                                     Host Mode


    You may create a CONFIG.SYS file using your favorite editor or word
    processor (be sure to save it as a non-document, or ASCII file).  If you
    add or change any of the commands in the configuration file, or create a
    new one, the changes are not in effect until the next time you start DOS,
    so be sure to reboot.  Consult your DOS manual for more information about
    configuring your system.

    The command in the CONFIG.SYS file that we are concerned with is the
    FILES= statement.  This command controls the number of files that can be
    open at one time.  The operating system default is 8; for ProComm we
    recommend 20 or higher.

    To set this statement, create (or edit) a CONFIG.SYS file in the root
    directory of the disk that you boot with.  Include in the CONFIG.SYS file
    a line that says

          FILES=x

    where x is 20 or greater.  A quick and easy way to create the CONFIG.SYS
    file is this:

      At the DOS prompt type

          COPY CON CONFIG.SYS <CR>
          FILES=20 <CR>
          ^Z <CR>                       (Press Ctrl-Z then <CR>)

    Remember, the CONFIG.SYS file, containing the FILES= statement, must be
    present in the root directory when you boot.  It has no effect otherwise.
    Increasing the FILES= parameter can also alleviate other problems
    indicated by "CAN'T OPEN FILE" messages and similar notices.


    ProComm Setup

    The SetUp facility (Alt-S) contains a section for Host Mode Setup.  The
    Host Mode setup screen contains six host options which must be
    initialized.  These options are also described in Section 3.

    The first option is the Host ID String.  The Host ID String is a text
    message that is displayed to callers after they connect.  It is usually
    used as a greeting.

    The second option is the modem auto-answer string.  This string is the
    command sent to the modem to place it into auto answer mode.  The default
    string, set for Hayes compatible modems, is "~~~+++~~~ATS0=1!", where

          ~~~ is a 1 1/2 second pause

          +++ drops the modem into command state

          ~~~ is a 1 1/2 second pause

          AT is the command prefix

          S0=1 sets modem to answer after one ring

          ! sends a <CR>.


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      802
    ProComm 2.4                                                     Host Mode



    When host mode is exited, the Modem Initialization String (specified in
    the Modem setup section) is sent to the modem to reset it.  If you do not
    want auto-answer to be on when you are not in host mode, include the
    command to turn it off within the Modem Initialization String.  That
    command is S0=0 for Hayes compatible modems.

    The third host option is the Host Access Password.  It may be up to 8
    characters long.  Callers must match the password exactly, including
    upper- and lower-case.  If you set the host access password to null,
    callers need only press <CR> at the password prompt to be allowed on your
    system.

    The fourth host option is the DOS Shell Password.  This password provides
    a second level of protection before callers are allowed access to the
    system level.  Be very careful with this one; you don't want just anyone
    to have access to the operating system level on your machine.

    The fifth host setup option is the Auto Baud Detect method.  Three
    choices are available: NONE, KEY HIT and MODEM MSG.  These choices
    determine what technique, if any, ProComm will use to attempt to
    synchronize baud rates with callers.

    The last host option is the Connection Type.  This allows you to run Host
    Mode either directly connected to another machine, or by using a modem.
    When set to Direct, ProComm automatically assumes a connection exists,
    and does not look for carrier or attempt baud rate synchronization.

    Once you have set the options and assured that your modem is correctly
    configured, you can place ProComm into Host Mode by pressing Alt-Q.  The
    auto-answer string is sent to the modem, and the local console displays
    "Waiting...".  In addition, a line is added to PROCOMM.HST, the host
    audit trail history file, that records the time and date.

    When a call comes in, and an Auto Baud Detect method other than None is
    specified, ProComm will attempt to match baud rates.  After the
    connection is complete, ProComm will send the Host ID String and prompt
    the user for his name.  The name is for informational purposes only.  The
    caller's name is then recorded in the history file.  ProComm then prompts
    the caller for the password.  The caller must match the password
    completely, including case.  All password attempts, both successful and
    otherwise, are recorded in the history file.  Callers get three chances
    to match the password; if they are unsuccessful after three tries,
    ProComm will hang up on them.

    If the caller makes it past the password, ProComm will display the
    contents of a special file called PROCOMM.MSG, if that file exists.  You
    can use this file as a welcome message, to display character graphics, or
    whatever.  Every 23 lines ProComm will halt, display a "[MORE]" message,
    and wait for any keystroke from the caller.  When a keystroke is
    received, the display of the file continues.  Use of the .MSG file is
    optional.

    After PROCOMM.MSG is displayed (if it is), the caller is presented with
    the host menu:

          F)iles  C)hat  D)ownload  U)pload  S)hell  G)oodbye

    ProComm 2.4                                                     Host Mode


    Callers make their choices by entering the first letter of an option and
    pressing <CR>.

    The F)iles option will send a list of the files in the current directory
    to the caller.  The list is not displayed on the local console.  F)iles
    uses the same facility as the Alt-F command, described earlier.
    If the caller chooses C)hat, an alarm on the host computer will sound for
    30 seconds.  The Host operator can press Space to chat with the caller.
    Pressing any other key will end the alarm and redisplay the host menu.
    If you have the alarm sound set off (via general setup at the Alt-S menu)
    no bells will sound on the local end.  Press <ESC> to return to the host
    menu when you are done chatting.

    D)ownload and U)pload work pretty much the same.  The caller is presented
    with the file transfer menu:

               K)ermit  M)odem7  T)elink  X)modem  Y)modem batch

    After selecting a protocol the caller may be prompted for a filename,
    depending upon the transfer direction and protocol used. The standard
    file transfer routines are used to perform the transfers.  Users are only
    allowed to download files in the current directory.  Similarly, all files
    uploaded will go to the current directory.

    The S)hell command is very powerful, but it also has the potential of
    being very dangerous.  It performs the equivalent of a "CTTY COMx"
    command, which basically redirects all console I/O out the COM port.  The
    Shell command puts the caller in charge of your computer at the operating
    system (DOS) level.  This means that a user can format your disk or
    whatever, so be very, very careful about who is allowed access to this
    command.  Use the Shell Password to protect yourself.  To return to
    ProComm, the user must enter "EXIT" at the DOS prompt.

    There are some restrictions when using the S)hell command.  For one, do
    not run programs that write directly to the screen buffer.  This will
    cause the host machine to appear to lock up.  If the host machine is
    running Dosedit, CED or a similar program, backspaces, escapes and
    possibly other key sequences can lock up the machine.  This problem
    arises from DOS and the other programs, not ProComm: there is nothing we
    can do about it.  In addition, some machines we have tried the host mode
    on do not pipe I/O to the correct port.  We have not yet determined if
    this is a DOS or BIOS problem, but be aware that it may occur.  We
    suggest that you thoroughly test Host Mode before making it available to
    callers.

    The G)oodbye option logs the caller out and places a notice to that
    effect in the history file.

    One additional command that is not listed on the menu allows a caller to
    shut down Host Mode from the remote side.  If a user enters a Ctrl-Z, he
    will be prompted for a password.  ProComm uses the Shell Password for
    this feature.  If the user correctly enters the password, he will be
    logged off and ProComm will drop out of Host Mode.  This is useful if you
    begin Host Mode from a command file, and wish to continue with the
    execution of that command file.

    On the local side, the host operator has several options.  You may press
    <ESC> to leave host mode and return to Terminal Mode.  Press Ctrl-X to

    log off the current  user.  All other keystrokes act as if the caller
    sent them and thus allow you to help novice users through the menus.

    NOTE: Host mode, especially the S)hell command, opens a few more files.
    You must be certain that the FILES= statement in your CONFIG.SYS file is
    set high enough, preferably at FILES=20.

                         APPENDIX A - TERMINAL EMULATION



                                    Overview


    ProComm emulates a number of popular terminals.  ProComm handles most of
    the standard features and many of the extended features of the terminals
    emulated.  Functions of these terminals that are not emulated are still
    processed to insure that all control codes are handled properly.

    Because of the wide variety of protocol convertors on mainframe front-end
    processors, some keys may not function as expected.  These emulations
    have been tested with the mainframe systems at the University of
    Missouri, Columbia and the University of California, Berkeley, as well as
    within private industry.  If you encounter a problem, refer to the
    TRANSMITTED CODES column in the terminal emulation charts on the
    following pages to see if ProComm is sending the code your protocol
    convertor is expecting.

    If you encounter any errors in these emulations or have any questions,
    please let us know.

                                    ANSI-BBS


    This is the recommended emulation for use with bulletin board systems
    that use ANSI graphics and color.  The ANSI-BBS mode processes the ANSI
    codes given in the DOS technical reference manual, and behaves in the
    same manner as the DOS ANSI.SYS device driver.  (ProComm does not use the
    ANSI.SYS driver itself).  This emulation is similar to the VT-100
    emulation, but the VT-100 emulation handles normal, bold, and reverse
    video in a different manner. The VT-100 keyboard mapping is used with

                APPENDIX C - ANSWERS TO COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS


    Question:

    When using the redial facility, or making a call from a command file, the
    program doesn't realize when I've made a connection.

    Answer:

    Make sure that ProComm's modem connect string is correctly defined for
    the message your modem returns for when a connection is made.  The
    ProComm default is "CONNECT".


    Question:

    I sometimes have trouble opening files for logging or downloading.  That
    is, sometimes the download or log features don't seem to work.

    Answer:

    You may need to increase the FILES= parameter in your CONFIG.SYS file.
    We suggest using at least FILES=20.  Consult your DOS manual for more
    details.


    Question:

    I can't get the dialing directory to call using the long distance code
    I've put in the number.

    Answer:

    Specify the long distance code to be used when you make the call itself,
    not when you enter the number into the directory.  For instance, say
    "#37" at the "==>" prompt to dial entry number 37 using the '#' long
    distance code.  Entering a long distance code as part of the number will
    not work.


    Question:

    I'm having trouble getting ProComm to work with my PCjr. Any ideas?

    Answer:

    The PCjr is somewhat different in the way it handles communications.  A
    solution that has worked for a number of users is this:  Call our BBS and
    download a file called COMSWAP.ARC.  After un-arcing the file you should
    find 2 programs called COMSWAP.COM and COMREST.COM.  Run COMSWAP before
    running ProComm and run COMREST after.  Then use ProComm set to COM2:.


    Question:



    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      1101
    ProComm 2.4                                                    Appendix C


    When I'm using a multi-tasking operating system and running ProComm in
    the background, window displays bleed through to the active partition.

    Answer:

    Go into the general SetUp screen and set ProComm to use the BIOS screen
    write method.  It is much slower but will not cause the bleed through
    that you are experiencing.


    Question:

    When I try to use the DOS gateway it says 'Command processor not found'.
    What does this mean?

    Answer:

    In order to use the gateway, ProComm must load a secondary copy of the
    command processor (COMMAND.COM).  It uses the environment variable
    COMSPEC to determine the name and location of the command processor.
    COMSPEC is set at system startup to the drive, directory and program you
    booted from.  Problems can arise if you boot off a floppy, and then
    change the floppy in the boot disk drive.  To use the gateway, and the
    Alt-F function, be sure that COMSPEC is set and that the command
    processor is where COMSPEC says it is.


    Question:

    I can't use the help screen because MultiLink grabs the ALT-F10 keystroke
    before ProComm can get it.

    Answer:

    MultiLink provides an 'escape' keystroke to avoid that problem.  Simply
    press Alt-F9 before pressing Alt-F10 and MultiLink will let the Alt-F10
    through to ProComm.


    Question:

    When I call online systems like CompuServe or the Source via Telenet, I
    get nothing but garbage characters on my screen.

    Answer:

    When using public networks such as Telenet or Tymnet, you must either
    call in at E/7/1 (even parity, 7 data and 1 stop bits), or strip the high
    bit off each incoming character using the translate table.


    Question:

    When I try to run Host Mode it always thinks that somebody is online;
    that is, it will automatically go to the "Name: " prompt and then keep
    cycling.

    Answer:


    Copyright (C) 1986 DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.                      1102
    ProComm 2.4                                                    Appendix C



    You must set your modem so that it does not force carrier detect (CD)
    high, or true.  This is usually controlled by a dip switch on your modem.
    For example, on a Hayes external modem, set dip switch 6 to the up
    position.


    Question:

    I'm trying to get two computers running ProComm to talk to each other
    using a direct connection.  What do I do?

    Answer:

    You need to connect the two machines using a null modem cable.  A null
    modem cable has the usual configuration for a serial port to modem
    connection, with the exception that pins 2 and 3 must be crossed.  That
    is pin 2 on one end needs to go to pin 3 on the other, and vice versa.
    Then make sure that each side is using the same line parameters.  You
    should be able to talk back and forth between the machines while in
    terminal, or chat modes (like Crosstalk's GO LOCAL).  You may even run
    Host Mode on one machine; just remember to set the Connection Type option
    in the Host Mode Setup area to Direct.


    Question:

    ProComm doesn't work with my NeoClone modem that I bought in a garage
    sale in Taiwan.  Why not?

    Answer:

    ProComm, by default, is set for use with Hayes compatible modems.  If
    your modem is not truly Hayes compatible, you will have to change some of
    the SetUp Options, especially the Modem Initialization string and the
    Modem Dial command, to values correct for your modem.  This may entail a
    little digging in your modem manual.  User groups and local bulletin
    boards may be able to provide information on using your particular brand
    of modem.

                      APPENDIX E - USER SUPPORTED SOFTWARE



    User-supported software is a means for the computing community to receive
    quality software while directly supporting software authors.  It is based
    on the ideas that:

          The value and utility of software is best assessed by the
          user on his or her own system.  Only after using a program
          can one really determine whether it serves personal
          applications, needs and tastes.

          The creation of independent personal computer software can
          and should be supported by the computing community.

          Copying of programs should be encouraged, rather than
          restricted.  The ease with which software can be distributed
          outside traditional commercial channels reflects the
          strength, rather than the weakness, of electronic
          information.

    Under the user supported concept, anyone may request a copy of a
    user-supported program by sending a blank, formatted disk to the program
    author together with an addressed, postage-paid return mailer.  A copy of
    the program, along with documentation on disk, will be sent by return
    mail on the user's disk.

    The program carries a notice suggesting registration for the program. You
    should register if you are going to use the program on a regular basis.
    Regardless of whether you register and use the program, you are
    encouraged to copy and distribute the program for the private,
    non-commercial, trial use of others.

    User supported software is generally not public domain material; most
    programs of this nature carry a copyright notice.  Rather, the author has
    licensed you to copy and use the program under certain conditions.
    Likewise, user supported software is not intended to be free software; it
    is an experiment in economics, not altruism.  It is intended to provide
    quality software at a low price, while directly supporting the author,
    without the overhead of distributors, dealers and advertising that
    produces $500 software packages.

    User supported software is having a hard time.  More and more packages
    are being taken out of this market, and offered as more traditional, and
    expensive, products.  The reason for this is simple: lots of people are
    using the packages but very few are paying for them.  And without the
    support of the users, there is absolutely no incentive for software
    authors to provide their programs in this fashion.

    There are many good reasons to register.  Besides supporting the author
    (that is, paying for the software you use), you generally get better
    support and receive mailed notification of updates and other products.

    Some authors provide diskettes and documentation with registration; due
    to our low registration fee DATASTORM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. does not,
    although diskettes and manuals are available at a very low price (see
    Ordering Information in the front of this manual).

    In conclusion, if you regularly use a user supported program (sometimes
    called Freeware or Shareware) and have not sent in a registration to the
    author, please do so now.  Only through the financial support of users
    will this kind of inexpensive software continue to be available.

                          APPENDIX F - PRODUCT SUPPORT



    In order to support our users, and to provide a means of distribution, we
    have implemented a bulletin board system you can use to communicate with
    us.  If you have questions or comments you may call us up and leave a
    note.  In your note, describe as completely as possible the problem you
    are having.  Let us know your machine configuration, your ProComm
    configuration and version and any resident software you are using.
    Describe what steps you take before the problem occurs, and exactly what
    the program does when it occurs.  If you do not provide us with a
    complete description of the problem there is little we can do to help.
    We'll do our best to keep you up and running, but if you are not a
    registered user we do not guarantee to provide support of any kind.

    You'll always be able to find the latest version of ProComm on the BBS.
    The number for our board is (314) 449-9401.  The board is operational 24
    hours per day.  Due to the incredibly high volume of calls that we are
    receiving, the BBS is often busy.  You will probably need to put ProComm
    into auto redial and let it work for a while before you get in.  We plan
    to install a second line for the benefit of registered users.

    If you do go online to use, please remember a few things:

          We have thousands of users to support, plus a product to maintain
          and a business to run.  You will most likely not receive an
          immediate response.  Please be patient.  We usually take care of
          registered users in 2 or 3 days at the most.

          We do not guarantee to provide support of any kind to non-
          registered users.  We do, in fact, provide many hours of support to
          non-paying users, but we do this at our discretion.  Non-supporting
          users who demand support from us are usually out of luck.  Please
          be patient, and please be polite.

    In addition to our board, several fine systems always carry the latest
    version of ProComm. They are:
